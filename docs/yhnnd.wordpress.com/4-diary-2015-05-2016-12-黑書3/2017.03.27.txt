the Bad Luck

i've been suffering a lot these days.

The first thing, i lost my Mitsubishi Uniball pen on Sunday.

The second one, i bought a counterfeit book on Sunday.

The third, on Monday i played basketball for a whole afternoon and had no time to partake dinner and thus felt very tired at the upcoming Japanese class.

The fourth, on Tuesday i could not open my class schedule and almost was late for algorithm class. And when i was editing my class schedule, teacher asked me to answer a question, i wasn't listening before so i couldn't come up with an idea. And the next half time of the class, i was sleepy to death.
