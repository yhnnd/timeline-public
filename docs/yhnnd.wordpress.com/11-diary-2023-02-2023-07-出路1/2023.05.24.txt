Childhood Memories 2007

I have got many color pencils.
Now I can tell you
some things on my diary!

1
When I was a little boy, I
was fond of eating chocolate.
One day, I wanted to eat
chocolate and my father gave
me some money to buy some chocolate.
I got to the shop and buy one
bar of chocolate and the shopkeepper
gave me two yuan for my change.
When I got home. My father ask
me for the change but I can't find
it, my father was very angry with
me. From that day on, I didn't lost
my money untill today!

When I was a little boy, I was fond
of making makings. My friends often
let me to make some makings to
let them have a look.

In the fall, the leaves was turn yellow
and I put them in my bag, the leaves
was yellow, long and thin and I called
them: "The needle of the dry leaves".

In the winter, I often play with my
little brothers: Yu Haiping and Sun Ting.
Yu Haiping is very artful and Sun Ting is
alittle fool.

When I got to my grandma's house to play,
I often play with the earth and the water but
my brother Yu Haiping often watches TV
all the time.

My brother Yu Haiping can't sing songs but
I can sing songs well. I often sing songs for
my grandma and the friends of my grandma.

There is a lot of fun of my grandma's house
and I often bought some jelly from that
shop. My grandma's house's water is very nice,
it's cool and sweet.

Many years ago, My grandpa bought two little
dogs and they are very lovely. I often played
with them. Their color is white, yellow and
brown. One of them is very fat and another
is very thin, so I called them "little fat" and
"little thin". When I got to my grandma's house,
The two dogs are very glad to see me but
when I am going to leave, They are very sad.

The dogs is very lovely, and the chickens
is very lovely, too.

Many years ago, There is a man who was
selling some chickens, I'd like to buy some of
them. I was very happy to feed them.
They are too many and I can't find out
the different among them, so I didn't
make the name for them.
