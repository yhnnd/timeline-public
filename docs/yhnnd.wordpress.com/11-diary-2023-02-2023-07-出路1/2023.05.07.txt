In 2013 Summer. I'm sitting on the steel stool beside the chess board table in the fourth middle school of Da'yan. And the sun is shining above my head and i feel free and pure joy cuz i'm finally graduated from the fucking high school that i hate so much.
I sat there enjoying the warm sunlight and listen to the song Moves Like Jagger and it was just great and uncapable of any description.
It's like all of a sudden all my bad memories were slashed 

In 2010 Summer. I graduated from middle school and i feel liberated and all i did in that summer was wandering around the neighborhood aimlessly and it feels so good and i've never felt like that for a long time since i have spend most of my time in the classroom and home for doing homeworks.
I went to the villages in the southeast of my home and i haven't been there for years since i attended middle school.

The teachers treat me badly in my middle school and i finally graduated from that shit place.
There was this cottage and courtyard which is beautiful and isolated and near the hill and that area is the border of the Da'yan town.
I've never been there before. I wonder if there's people living in there.
The ground is muddy and the grass's spreading around the fence alongside the road.
It feels like somewhere I've been to before but it's not real.
