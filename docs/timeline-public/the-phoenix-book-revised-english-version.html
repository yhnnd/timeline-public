When there is no such world, God exists. God has no predecessor and has no successor. And God Said: Let there be a realm and it should have a boundary, and I will create a world inside it. Everything in the World that I create will change all the time inside the boundary that I give, until I call this World to end. And there is no time in this World. And God said: The time I created this World is the beginning, and the time I destroy this World is the end. The end is the beginning. and in a glimpse in the midst of it, has infinite time. And therefore, the World has been created.

And God looked below and He saw the sea. And God made earth and the earth descended on the sea, and there are four drops of earth. Every drop of earth became an island. The first drop is the Island of the Sun, Heliosland. God created the Sun, and He called this island Heliosland. The second drop is the land of the stars. God created the Moon and all stars, and He called this island the land of the stars. The third drop of earth is the Island of the Storm.

For the following content, please refer to Chapter 8 "Lant's Prophecy" in "Book of the Ancient Phoenix".

History background:
When Prophet Lant was born, when the rest of the world was a barbaric land, the Phoenix Kingdom and the Star Kingdom had already been established.

The founding of the Phoenix Kingdom:
Terra Firma, where the ancient ancestors lived, is now called the Commercial Port City. To the north of Commercial Port City is Phoenix City, and to the south of Commercial Port City is the Realm of Stars. The road from the Star Kingdom's Imperial City to Phoenix City is called Commercial Port Road. The Nasanites and Solanders established the Phoenix Kingdom to the north of the commercial port city. The capital of the Phoenix Kingdom is Phoenix City, which was founded by the Svarts. The Svarts are the Svarthhorsts. The Nasanites are the descendants of Nassan, the eldest son of the ancient ancestor Thalifurow. The Nasanites live in Phoenix and the areas around Phoenix. There are Kahorst, Amberhorst, and Dolethorst, and Svarthhorst.


page 5

The founding of the Kingdom of Stars:
Scollokast did not migrate from Terra Firma to the Phoenixland region in the north of Star Island, but moved south to live in the Uduria region. Scollokast married Mermaid, a princess of Eudoria, who gave birth to Hipuskas and Strotikas. Hipuskas married Shalimar, daughter of Nilkan, a Solander, and Shalimar gave birth to Kasnafuet. Kasnafuet led the Freistoks and Solanders to attack the Eudorians, defeated the enemy at the town of Vine Bridge, and captured Eudolia. The ancient city of Eudolia is now the imperial city of Star Kingdom. Kasnafuet married Lucia, daughter of Darls of Mosor. Lucia gave birth to Kasulen to Kasnafuet. Kasulen, son of Kasnafuet, married Melka the Nasanite. Melka is a native of Svathost and the daughter of Shinder Svathost II, king of the Phoenix Kingdom. Melka gave birth to Lantikas to Kasulen.

Editor's note: The Mosor people are the descendants of Weestis, the son of Fuman.


The following is the prophecy of the prophet Lant:
God said: "I created humans and ordered humans to guard and take care of all living things. But humans went against my will. So I will destroy the humans living on the Island of Life. Only Thalifurow and Nova are the ones I love."
Thalifurow and Nova begat Nassan and Kasalot.
Kasalot begat Flastoker.
Flastoker begat Scollokast.
Scollokast begat Hipuskas.
Hipuskas was the father of Kasnafuet.
Kasnafuet begat Kasulen.
Kasulen begot Lantikas. Lantikas is Lant.


The following words were written by this Lant under the inspiration of God.
Scollokast married Momei in Uduria by the sea. Hipuskas, son of Scollokast, knew Eudorian from an early age. Because his mother, Momei, taught him to speak Eudorian. Scollokast had a friend who was Nilkan from Solander. Merme was particularly fond of Nilkan's daughter Sallymar and regarded her as her own daughter. One day, Scollokast's wife Mome asked Nirgan if she could let Sallymar live in her home, and Nirgan agreed. So Princess Eudoria Momei raised Hipuskas and Sallymar. Hypskas, the son of Merme, fell in love with Sallymar, the daughter of Nirgan, and they gave birth to Kasnafoyet. Kasnafuet is a Eudorian word meaning deep blue sea. Scollokast and Nilkan were ministers to King Eudoria. After the death of King Eudoria, Scollokast and Nilkan jointly took over the affairs of state. After the death of Scollokast and Nilkan, the Eudorians were left without a king. Hipuskas, son of Scollokast, was elected king of Eudoria, and his wife Sallymar became queen. Five years after Hipuskas became king of Eudoria, his brother Skrostikas secretly united with the nobles of Eudoria to overthrow his brother and king Hipuskas. Hipuskas and Queen Shalimar were exiled. The Mosor Darls took in Hipuskas and his wife. Darls taught Kasnafuet swordsmanship in his own home. The exiled prince Kasnafuet falls in love with Lucia, the young daughter of the teacher Darls. The exiled prince Kasnafuet was a great hero. After the death of the exiled king Hipuskas, the usurper Skrostikas also died. Kasnafuet led the Flastoker, Solander, and Mosor to defeat the Eudorians in the town of Vine Bridge and capture the city of Eudoria. Eudoria City is now the Imperial City of Star Kingdom. Kasnafuet married Lucia, the daughter of Darls, a native of Mosor, in the imperial city. Kasnafuet and his wife Lucia founded the Star Kingdom.


page 6

The once exiled prince now became the first king of the Kingdom of Stars. Lucia gave birth to Kasulen to King Kasnafuet. Kasulen is the second king of the Star Kingdom. He is married to Melka Svathost, the princess of the Phoenix Kingdom. Lant, the son of Kasulen, learned in a dream that the Star Kingdom was about to perish, so he gave up the throne and gave it to Highman Skrostikas, a descendant of the usurper Skrostikas.

In the dream, God told Lant: "Lantikas, son of Cassulan and Melka, after the death of your father Cassulan Hepskas, a violent storm will sweep across the Star Kingdom. If you inherit the throne, you and your brothers will be killed by thieves. The only way out is to give up the throne to Highman Skrostikas. Then take your mother Melka Svarthhorst and you brothers leave the Kingdom of Stars. You will go all the way north to the Vinyard manor outside Phoenix City. There, you will meet your future wife: Amberhost Raka (Laka). In Vinyard, you and Laka will have three children. The descendants of this first child will be the monarchs of the Phoenix Kingdom, and the descendants of this second child will be the monarchs of the Sun Island. Monarch, the descendants of this third child will be the monarchs of the islands in the north of the Phoenix Kingdom."

When Lant woke up from his dream, news of the death of his father, King Kasulen, came. He immediately took off his noble clothes and rushed into the temple. When everyone saw the prince's sad expression, they also felt sad.

After burying his father, King Kasulen. Lant said:
"Servants, prepare horses and food now for my mother, my brothers, and me. We are going to the Phoenix Kingdom."
The servants prepared horses for them, and Lant ordered his abdication edict to be read. Afterwards, Lant, his family and servants immediately left the imperial city.

The content of the abdication edict is:
"Lantikas Hipuskas, son of Kasulen Hipuskas and Melka Svathost, is here, by divine revelation Declare that I and my brothers will relinquish the throne of the Kingdom of the Stars and all the fiefs and titles of Eudoria to Highman Skrostikas, the third grandson of Skrostikas. and its heirs. The territory of Eudoria is south of the commercial port city and west of the frozen river."

They continued north along the Commercial Port Road and arrived at the Commercial Port City, Terra Firma, five days later.
In a dream, God revealed to Lant: "Lantikas, son of Cassulan and Melka, you must obey my instructions carefully. You must burn your royal robes. After you arrive in the Phoenix Kingdom, you must not Enter Phoenix so as not to alarm the Svarthhorsts. Stay outside the city at Fynyard Manor. There I have prepared for you my servant Reis the Amberhorst. Reis You will be protected from discovery by the Nasanites or the Solanders."
Sure enough, they found God's servant Reis in Fenyard. Reis took great care of Melka, Melka's son Lant, and Lant's brothers. Reis knew that Lant was a messenger of God and a prophet inspired by God, and respected him very much. During the reign of King Shinder Svathost V of the Phoenix Kingdom, Reis married his daughter Laka Amberhost to Lant.

Lant planted trees and plowed the fields together with his servants. One day, Lant fell asleep after a day of farming.
In the dream, God said to Lant: "Lantikas, the son of Cassulan and Melka, your wife Laka will bear two sons for you. You must educate these two sons carefully, because they are The founder of all nations. You are to name this first son Ansteras (meaning 'virtuous'), for among his descendants there will be virtuous kings. This second son, you shall name him Sensteras (meaning 'prudent'), for among his descendants there will be humble and noble electors. The descendants of this first son will The Phoenix Kingdom is famous. The descendants of this second son will be the focus of attention in the Kingdom of the Sun. After that, Raqqa will give birth to a third son for you, and you will name him Tiransteras (meaning of Tiransteras is 'distant'), because there is no sea or island that will not leave traces of the voyages of his descendants, even to the ends of the earth. Among his descendants, there will be great navigators."
The above are all God’s revelations to Lant. It was this Lant who wrote these words.
Everything God promised to Lant, God fulfilled.
Since Lant, his mother and brothers moved to the Phoenix Kingdom, Lant has never returned to the Realm of Stars.

Chapter 2 The History of Phoenixland

Volume 1
The god-ordained phoenix bird saved the ancient ancestor Thalifurow from disaster and blessed him. God made him the ancestor of mankind.
Thalifurow and Nova lived in Terra Forma on Star Island, and their descendants spread all over Star Island.
Thalifurow was the father of Nassan and Kasalot, Nassan was the father of Bal, Bal was the father of Jesot, Jesot was the father of Svarthhorst.
Jesot means hardworking, and he was blessed by God throughout his life. God blessed his four sons and said:
"My servant Jesot, your descendants will be fruitful and numerous. The descendants of your eldest son Karhost will be knights who will fight for justice; the descendants of your second son Amberhorst will be me. Servants, they will offer me a sweet-smelling burnt offering; the descendants of your fourth son Svarthhorst will be noble men, they will be able, they will build great cities."
In response to this prophecy, the Svarthhorsts, descendants of Svarthhorst, built Phoenix City to the west of Phoenix Mountain.

The following tells the story of the founding of Phoenix.
God said to Svarthhorst in a dream: "Get up, Svarthhorst. You must come to my mountain and offer sacrifices to me. That mountain is where I sent the phoenix to save my servant Thalifurow. My mountain. You and your descendants will always guard my mountain. I will give you honor and peace."
So Svarthhorst invented a carriage, took his wife and said goodbye to his father and brothers, and went to the mountain of God, which is Phoenix Mountain.
There was a forest at the foot of that mountain, and in the forest lived the Nasanites.
The sons of Svarthhorst went down into the forest to chop wood and met the daughter of the Nasanite. Because they were beautiful, they loved them in their hearts, so they deceived them into the mountains and defiled them. The sons of Nassan searched for their sisters, and the shouting reached the mountains. When the sons of Svarthhorst heard it, they said to one another, "If they hear from their sisters what we have done, they will surely Kill us. If we want to save our lives, we have to kill them."

So the sons of Svarthhorst tricked and killed the sons of Nassan with axes.
After the sons of Nassan were killed, their souls cried out to God for justice.
God said to Svarthhorst: "Svarthhorst, what have you done? Where is your son? What have they done on the holy mountain that I have blessed? Behold, their hands They are stained with blood. They have done unrighteous things. They have followed the devil and done sinful things, taking lives and ruining My name. The voices accusing them of their crimes have gone up to heaven. And are you still sleeping?"
With his face ashen as death, Svarthhorst knelt on the ground and begged God to forgive his sons' sins.

God said, "Your sons have done unrighteous things. Their hands are stained with the blood of vengeance. Behold, they have listened to the devil and done abominable things. They are killing innocent people on my mountain. This holy mountain has been stained with blood. From now on, I will call this mountain a mountain of blood. Anyone who kills a righteous person is a son of the devil. I will see the blood shed by the righteous and regard this blood as Holy. I will defeat the devil. I will curse the souls of those who follow the devil. I will punish them. The blood debt must be paid with blood. I will punish their descendants. Behold, their descendants will be punished for generations to come. They shall fight against the foreigners, and the nations will fight against them until I take back the honor I gave them and exchange it for humility and the pursuit of righteousness. Those to whom I have given shall receive what I have given."
Svarthhorst said: "I am not worthy to inherit what God has given me, and I am not worthy to live on God's mountain."
So Svarthhorst took his sons down from the mountain and went to the plain on the west side of the mountain. On the other side of the mountain was the forest where the Nasanites lived. The sons of Svarthhorst married the daughters of the Nasanites and had many children.

Svarthhorst was old and said to his sons on his death bed: "You must build a city in this place and let your descendants live in this city. Otherwise, when the enemy demands your blood, , you have nowhere to hide."
So Svarthhorst's descendants built Phoenix City on the plain west of Phoenix Mountain. To avoid God's punishment.

Volume 2

The Svarthhorst people built Phoenix City on the plain west of Phoenix Mountain.
At that time, on the plain west of Phoenix Mountain, there lived the Solanders, who were good at hunting on horseback. Their borders extend from the plains to the Black Mountains, the plains of Kusumania. There were savages fighting against them.
Once, the Solanders were ambushed by savages and were defeated. News of the Solanders' request for help spread to Phoenix City. So the people of Svarthhorst gathered in the synagogue to discuss how to deal with it. The elders said:
"We must help the Solanders, otherwise they will turn to the Nasanites for help, and we will lose allies and gain enemies for ourselves."
So they formed a blood alliance with the Solanders outside the city and went to conquer the wildlings together.
When they arrived at the junction of the plains and the forest, the Solanders told them not to enter the forest, lest they fall into the trap of the savages. So they burned the forest with fire and drove the savages as far as the Black Mountains.

To the southwest of Black Mountain is Eudoria, to the south of Black Mountain is Femot, and to the southeast of Black Mountain is Tiberia.
The savages gathered on the Black Mountain and rolled boulders down the mountain, hitting many people and horses.
About three hundred of the Svarthhorsts died, and many others were wounded, so they began to flee.
At this moment the Solander cavalry rushed into the wilds. There was a Solander man who was very brave and God was with him, so he killed many wild men with his spear, and the wild men began to flee.
The Solanders and Svarthhorsts pursued the wildlings as far as the borders of Kusumania and Tiberia. From there, the grass on the ground becomes increasingly scarce, and the land there is perennially frozen soil.
These escaped savages lived there, and their descendants are the Tomb Moon people.
After this victory, the territories of the Solanders and Svarthhorsts were consolidated.
At the suggestion of the Svarthhorst elders, the two clans began to marry and held banquets in the city. The daughters of the Solanders married the sons of the Svarthhorsts and entered the Phoenix City to live.

Volume 3

In Sylvania to the north of the Blood Mountain and Vaganatha to the east of the Blood Mountain, the Nasanites have lived here for generations.
The Svarthhorsts built huge carriages and widened the roads leading from Phoenix to all directions. Every day, merchants from the Commercial Port City bring cloth, silver, iron, tin, and copper from the Kingdom of Stars in exchange for wood and spices from Phoenix City.
This road is called Commercial Port Road. Because of this road, Phoenix is ​​more prosperous.
At the beginning of the city's founding, there were Svarthhorsts who married Nasanite daughters. Their descendants spoke the Nasanite language and believed in the Nasanite gods, so they were also called the Nasanites in the city. They intermarried with the Forest-Nasanites of Varganatha, and the descendants of the Nassan from these cities and the Forest-Nasanites were found in Phoenix and Sylvania.
There are also many Svarthhorsts who intermarried with the Solanders. They and the Solanders had a high prestige in the city because their fathers were heroes who defeated and expelled the barbarians. At this time, the conflict between them and the Nasanites was getting bigger and bigger. They hoped that the Nasanites would not occupy Sylvania, but return to the great forest of Vaganasa where their ancestors lived; while the Nasanites hoped that Solander The people returned to the Kusumania plain where their ancestors lived, leaving Sylvania untouched.

This conflict intensified, and finally one day, a fierce battle broke out between the two tribes.
It happened in the city. During a competition, a Solander accidentally killed a Nasanite in the city.
The Nasanites in the city gathered together to demand the blood of the Solanders who had accidentally killed someone. The Solander evaded them and fled to a friend's house. Friend said:
"Escape from the city by night. Don't fall into the hands of the Nasanites."
The Solander native said:
"If I run away, wouldn't I be trapping myself in injustice? If I do this, how can I prove my innocence?"
Friend said:
"If you lose your life trying to prove your innocence, even if you succeed in proving it, what's the use?"
The Solander native said:
"If I am guilty and God wants me to die, how can I complain?"
"But if I die unjustly, God will punish the evil one and avenge me."

So the Solander insisted on staying in the city, and did not listen to the advice of his friends and fled out of the city at night. Then one day, he was discovered on the street. The Nasanites in the city caught him, tied him outside the city, and killed him. This matter spread, and many people knew about it. His friends found his body outside the city, and Solander gave him a grand funeral. At the funeral, people angrily denounced the Nasanites who killed him. At this time, a young man climbed up to a high place and shouted: "Blood debt must be paid with blood."
Suddenly, the funeral turned into a swearing-in ceremony.
Just as God predicted, the sin committed by Svarthhorst's sons on the Bloody Mountain was a curse that would forever be engraved on the souls of their descendants.

People ran and shouted throughout the city, and the Solanders and the Nasanites in the city were killing each other everywhere. The fighting stretched from the city to Sylvania. The Nasanites in Sylvania knew nothing about this and were unprepared. The Solanders raised an army from Phoenix and attacked Sylvania, killing many Nasanites. The Nasanites of Sylvania fled into the forest.
At night, the Sylvanians came back from the forest and fought with the Solanders who woke up from their dreams. The Solanders started fires and burned down many houses.
After this war, the Nasanites and Sylvanians in the city suffered a heavy blow and never recovered. However, the power of the Solanders in Phoenixland is growing. This echoes what God said in the past:
"I will punish their descendants. Their descendants will fight against the descendants of the Gentiles from generation to generation until I take back the honor I gave them and replace it with humility and the pursuit of righteousness."

Volume 4

The news that the Solanders massacred foreigners in Phoenix City and Sylvania spread from the Phoenix Kingdom to the Star Kingdom, and people in the Star Kingdom were talking about it. they said:
"Dear Eudorians, I think you have heard about what happened in the Phoenix Kingdom recently. We must be prepared for these things, otherwise, what happened in Sylvania will one day also happen. Come upon us."
So they stationed troops on the commercial port road, from Eudoria City to the commercial port city. They camped outside the city and built huge chariots. The people of the Star Kingdom worked day and night to make weapons and sent cavalry to patrol the Tigris River.

When the Solanders heard of these things they said:
"The people of the Star Country just want to attack us and rob us of our food and livestock. How can we just surrender?"
So they sent envoys to the Kingdom of Stars.
The envoys of the Solanders arrived at the city of Eudoria, and when they saw the king of the Eudoria, they said:
"Your Majesty, King of the Stars, we came all the way from Phoenixland because we heard that you wanted to attack us. Since the first king of the Kingdom of Stars, Kasnafoyet, established the Kingdom of Stars, we Solanders have been the most powerful people in the Kingdom of Stars. Firm allies, our two races have always maintained friendship and peace. Why is His Majesty not yet assured of us Solanders? Haven't we already become a bridge between Phoenix City and Eudoria City? Because Due to the friendship between the two countries, your country's commercial port city is becoming more and more prosperous. We are messengers of peace, not war makers. Will we be enemies of the Skrostikas dynasty? "

King of Stars said:
"I believe that you Solanders will not be my enemies, but my people said to me, please allow us to make swords to protect ourselves, lest we be killed, as happened in Phoenix and Sylvania. The same."
It turned out that during the riots in Phoenix City and Sylvania, some people from the Star Country were also killed as foreigners.
The messenger from the Solanders said:
"Although life is more difficult than death, life is more valuable than death. Maintaining peace is more difficult than waging war, but there is no winner in war, and the fruit of war is only death. And the fruit of peace is life. I hope that your Majesty will live under your royal authority for these Men and women who can make peace with us and avoid a senseless war."

King of Stars said:
"Although I am willing to do this, I also believe that you are sincerely asking me for this peace. However, my people do not believe you. If you can use one thing to prove your sincerity. Use this thing as evidence, come and talk to me Sign a peace treaty and I will promise you this peace."
The messenger said: "When I return, I will report the king's decree to the emperor truthfully."
Ten days later, the Kingdom of Stars received a gift from the Solanders. There are plenty of fine gold, spices, and gopher wood.
The messenger from the Solanders said:
"Solanders offer these gifts to the king. May the two countries always be friendly and never have war on the border. May God bless you and may God witness."
King of Stars said:
"I see your sincerity and I am very satisfied. However, my people are so numerous. How should I distribute these gifts to them? If they don't believe it, how can I convince them?"

The messenger said:
"It's not difficult to convince your people, just convince your generals."
King of Stars said:
"May everything be as you wish, and may God be your witness."
So the Star King sent an envoy to the commercial port city to sign a peace treaty with the Solanders, agreeing that the Star Kingdom would never be an enemy of the Solanders.
The minister of the Star King said to the Star King:
"Your Majesty, if the Solanders can use money to convince Your Majesty and His Majesty's generals to lay down their arms and not attack them, they can also use money to convince His Majesty's generals to serve for them. If this continues, Your Majesty's royal power will be in danger."
King of Stars said:
"What do you think we should do?"
The minister of the Star King said:


page 11

"Why don't we use money to bribe the generals of the Solanders first, make them take it lightly, and then suddenly attack them when they don't expect it, seize their belongings, and drive them away from the commercial port city, so that the Star Kingdom will be safe."

King of Stars said:
"If they accept our gifts, don't listen to us, and leak this matter, won't they attack us earlier?"
The minister of the Star King said:
"Why don't we bribe their king, so they won't attack us before we attack them."
King of Stars said:
"Just do as you say."
So the Star King sent people to give the Solanders a large number of rare treasures, a large number of brocades, and hundreds of beauties and warriors.

The Solanders feasted, sang and danced day and night, made peace with the beauties from the Kingdom of the Stars, and had lewd and merrymaking.
At night, the King of Stars' secret envoy arrived at Commercial Port City and ordered the officials in charge of the city to summon soldiers, capture the Solanders in the city, and take them to the imperial city. The Star King's army crossed the Tigris River at night and reached the realm of the Phoenix Kingdom, chasing the Solanders everywhere. They attacked the Solanders' camp and the Solanders were defeated. Five thousand Solanders were killed by them, all men who had been on the battlefield. Many Solander women were also taken captive. They were taken to the trading port city, treated as trophies, and sold at the price of slaves. sell.
Everyone in Commercial Port City knows this. Even the children in the commercial port city were running in the alleys singing:
"The beauties of the Eudorians are a hundred, and the beauties of the Solanders are five thousand. The soldiers of the Eudolians are five hundred dead, and the men of Solanders are five thousand dead."

After this happened, the Solanders of Phoenix gathered together in Phoenix, and they said:
"We have sinned, and death is coming to us. God has come to punish us personally. We must repent to God, ask God to forgive our sins, and ask God to give us peace. Ask God to give us power so that we can defeat the enemy."
So the Solanders in Phoenix tore their clothes to pieces, knelt naked in the dust and repented to God. They took the beauties and warriors whom the King of the Stars had given to the Solanders and took them outside the trading port and beheaded them.
After this, the aforementioned Solander envoy who was sent by the Solanders to the Star Kingdom to negotiate peace said:
"The King of the Stars has deceived and blasphemed my God. He is the enemy of me and my people. I must kill him. Please ask God to do this."

So he disguised himself as a businessman and sneaked into the imperial city of Star Kingdom, hoping to assassinate the king of Star Kingdom. His assassination attempt failed and the Star King ordered his soldiers to arrest him. At this point, he said:
"God, it was I who signed this peace treaty with the King of Stars, and it was I who killed the Solanders. They all died in vain, and I cannot continue to survive in this world. Please God to take in my soul."
After saying these words, he committed suicide.

After these things happened, Prophet Rant said:

"O Terra Firma, you were once the land of God’s blessings, you were once the place of life and hope, but now you have become a den of wickedness and sinners, you have become a refuge for sin and conspiracy. Behold, Evil breeds in you, and sin takes over your soul. You were once blessed by God, but you have become an accomplice of the devil. You were once the source of life, and now you are a hotbed of evil. You were once blessed by God, but because of Because of your sin, you are cursed by God."

"O Kingdom of Stars, your heart is full of deceit and deceit. You say: Where is God? Why should I rely on God? I have deceived God, but God will forgive me. Although I am crafty and often do unrighteous things , but haven’t I already won by relying on trickery and conspiracy? Will our Skolausticas dynasty not be able to rule for eternity?"

"Therefore God says: O kingdom of the stars, you are full of evil and you are arrogant and blasphemous. Therefore I will punish you. I will cause your kingdom to perish and remove your kingdom from among the nations. Your people will be displaced and enslaved to the foreigners. Then you will know that I am a righteous God, and I will provide justice to those who are wronged."

Volume 5

This volume is called The War of Azaleas and Hibiscuses because the coat of arms of the Svarts is five azaleas and the coat of arms of the Solanders is four hibiscuses.
In the era when there was no king in the Phoenix Kingdom, there was a hero named Jacquet. He was a warrior of the Solanders and led the Solanders to defeat their enemies many times. Jacquet' family emblem is four hibiscus flowers.
In Phoenix City, there is a woman named Helena, who is extremely beautiful and falls in love with Jacquet. But her family was the Nassans of Sylvania. After they knew about this, they were firmly opposed to their love, because at that time the Nasanites of Phoenix and Sylvania did not interact with the Solanders, because Solanders People have a feud with them. So Jacquet took the woman to the Kusumania plain in Mount Black, where Jacquet' clan lived.

After the woman's three brothers heard about this, they beat their chests and beat their feet. They said that Jacquet, the Solander, had kidnapped their sister, and that they were going to Kusumania to bring her back.
After the woman's brother went to Kusumania, he had a dispute with the local Solanders and accidentally killed two Solanders. The Solanders took these people into prison and interrogated them for many days. They found that they came to Kusumania for their sister, the wife of Jacquet, so the Solanders took them to Hibiscus. Meet Jacquet.
Jacquet asked the Solanders to let them go and entertain them, but they did not thank him.
One night, while Jacquet was sleeping, they woke up their sister and wanted to take her away, but Jacquet woke up and found out, so he rode after them. Jacquet caught up with them, fought with them, and accidentally killed one of them. The other brothers caught Jacquet and killed him.

This incident alarmed the entire Kusumania Plain in Mount Black, so the Solanders arrested the woman and her brothers, put them in prison, and tortured them.
The Solanders held a grand funeral for Jacquet.
When the woman and her brothers' father heard about this, they fell into depression and died. The nobles and Sylvanians in Phoenix City were very angry when they heard about this incident. They threatened to go to Kusumania to find an explanation from the Solanders.
So the Nasanites in the city, the aristocratic children of the Svarts, and the Sylvanians outside the city all gathered in Phoenix City, and the people in the city shouted to rescue those righteous brothers.
So they began to search for Solanders everywhere, and many Solanders escaped from the city and fled to Kusumania, Mount Black.

The five great Svart nobles all sent their sons and servants, and soon they led everyone to Hibiscus.
The Solanders said to them:
"Friends, people say, "Don’t add new debts until old debts have been settled." We have no grievances against you Svart people, so why are we going to war?"
Svart said:
"We heard that residents of Phoenix City were imprisoned here, and we came here to find out the true situation."
Solander said:
"If it's because of this, please go back. Someone killed someone here, and they have confessed. They will receive a fair trial."

Svart said:
"Our Sylvanian brothers would probably disagree."
When the Solanders heard that there were troops coming from Sylvania and Phoenix, they ran around shouting, and all the Solanders from the plains of Kusumania came to Hibiscus with weapons in hand. So they began to fight, and the Solanders killed many Svarts. The Sylvanians set fire to the city, and surrounded it, preventing those within from escaping. So everyone in the city was burned to death.
The Sylvanians said to one another:
"We failed to rescue those brothers and returned to Phoenix City. If we say that we burned Hibiscus, people will blame us."

So they returned to Phoenix City and said to the people in the city:
"The Solanders killed the three brothers, and captured and burned many of the Svarts."
So all the people in the city gathered together to go to Kusumania in Mount Black to attack the Solanders.


page 13

Everyone in Phoenix City who could raise weapons was dispatched. Their flag was painted with five azaleas. There were three thousand soldiers and thousands of knights, and they marched toward the plains of Kusumania in a mighty manner.
They held negotiations in Mount Black with the king of the Solanders, who asked them to leave the realm of Kusumania, and they demanded that the king of the Solanders hand over the followers of Jacquet.
So the Svarts kidnapped the king of the Solanders and forced the Solanders to hand over Jacquet's followers.

Solander said:
"Jacquet is dead, and the person who killed Jacquet is also dead. We don't owe each other any more. Why are you still provoking now?"
Svart said:
"It all started because Jacquet kidnapped Helena. This happened first. You killed Helena's three brothers, angered their father to death, and burned many noble children of Phoenix City to death. You How can we escape the guilt? May the righteous God Himself judge."

So the Svarts and the Solanders fought against each other, and a thousand of the Svarts died, and two thousand of the Solanders died.

Unable to withstand the Svart attack, the Solanders fled to the Black Mountains, with the Svarts in hot pursuit.

The Solanders shot arrows down the mountain. The Svarts camped at the foot of the mountain and surrounded the Solanders.

The war lasted for several days. There were crows flying from all directions, gathering and covering the entire Kusumania plain in Mount Black. Those crows cover the sky and the sun cannot be seen during the day. In those days, there were days of torrential rain and hail, turning the entire plain into a swamp. The horses were all sick and died, and food and grass could not be transported. The soldiers were all sick and could not march. Many Svarts died in battle and illness, so the Svarts lifted the siege of Mount Black.

The Svarts began to withdraw. They destroyed many of the houses of the Solanders and took them captive back to Phoenix. The Svarts kidnapped the king of the Solanders, took him back to Phoenix City, and threw him from a building to his death.

This battle was called the Battle of Azaleas and Hibiscuses. All these disasters and tragedies are due to the love between Jacquet the Solander and Helena the Sylvanian.

After that, in order to take revenge, the Solanders attacked the hinterland of Phoenix City and plundered many Svart cities.

The Svarts sent troops from Phoenix City, cut off the road from Kusumania to Phoenix City and the Commercial Port City, and besieged the Solanders again. The Svart army besieged the Solanders in Mount Black for several months, in what is known as the Second Siege of Mount Black.

Previously, the Eudorians and the Solanders competed for the commercial port city, and the Solanders were defeated. The Eudolians took the Solanders from the commercial port city captive to the Eudolian Imperial City. During this period, the Eudorians and the Solanders were defeated. The Svarthhorsts reached a secret agreement, which required the Svarts not to aid the Solanders in the Terra Firma War. In return, Eudoria would grant the Svarts permission to establish a commercial port in the city after the war. Doing business is exempt from all taxes. Therefore, during the period after the war, many Svart merchants moved from Phoenixland to Terra Firma and lived in the commercial port city.

During the Second Siege of Mount Black, the Svarts sent troops to capture seven cities on the Kusumania plain, and the Solanders held on to the remaining four cities. These cities in Kusumania have been in the battle between the Svarts and the Solanders until the Phoenix Ancient King Tolman II established the Phoenix Kingdom in Phoenix City.

Chapter 3 The Biography of King Tolman II of Phoenixland

Volume 1

When a saint dies, even the sky becomes clouded. And when the tyrant dies, all people will sing for joy.

Why do people dare to express their anger against tyrants without fear of being imprisoned? Because the law does not punish everyone. Because this is the age of freedom, because this is the best of times. Before this era, everyone was hunted by ferocious beasts and had nowhere to hide. After this era, everyone is hunted by soldiers with guns and has no place to hide. There was no age before this age or the age after it, and there was no age better than this age. It was in this pastoral era that Tolman bar-Ansteras II was born. The dark clouds for days were hidden because of his birth, and the sun shone brightly on the earth because of his birth. Tolman II came to the world with God's great grace and teachings to complete what his father had neither the chance nor the ability to accomplish.

God once said to Lant: "Lantikas, son of Cassulan, your wife Laka will give birth to two children for you, and these two children are twin brothers. You must educate these two children carefully, because They are the fathers of all nations. You are to name this first son Ansteras, for among his descendants there will be virtuous kings."

In response to the aforementioned revelation by the God, Ansteras' great-great-grandson gave birth to Tolman, because on the day Tolman was born, a vermilion fire phoenix landed on the eaves of Ansteras' house. This Tolman is Tolman I, the father of the ancient king Tolman II.

Tolman I was capable of both civil and military skills, and he repeatedly won glory for the people of Phoenix City, and also brought justice and fairness to the people of Phoenix City. He designed the civil code for Phoenix City and established rural schools and synagogues to discuss various matters, large and small, and to adjudicate cases. The training ground he built for Phoenix is ​​still an important military location in Phoenix. He borrowed money from the Kingdom of the Sun to finance the Tiransteras' greatest voyage in history, which brought the Storm Islands, long hidden in the mist, onto the map of the world known to man.

However, people's destiny is not within their own control. God uses suffering to create classics. God wants to train the descendants of Prophet Lant. Because after suffering comes greater glory, after death comes rebirth.

Because the civilized reforms promoted by Tolman I had shaken the foundation of the slavery system they had relied on since ancient times, the Svarthhorst people conspired a trap to kill Tolman I. They bribed gangsters to enter Tolman I's home and killed Tolman I and his wife. Then they quickly killed the gangsters to silence them. Instead of hiding, they pretended not to know anything about Tolman I's death, and went to Tolman's home to express their condolences, pretending to be shocked and hurt, while they secretly rejoiced in their hearts. The ancient Phoenix King's book "The saint suffers, the traitor secretly rejoices" refers to this incident.

At that time, the body of Tolman I was carried to the seaside for cremation. Tolman II, who lost his parents, was wearing black mourning clothes and standing in the corner, silent and thoughtful. A noble silver-haired old man and a middle-aged silver-haired man walked up to Tolman II. The old man asked: "Child, why don't you cry for your father and mother who just passed away?"

Tolman II, who was wearing black mourning clothes, replied: "My parents have returned to their heavenly father, and I do not need to mourn. Someone must cry bitterly at this time, but the one who should cry bitterly is not me, but those who have sinned." And now I should just pray to God to give more justice to the world, and that’s enough."

The silver-haired old man said: "My child, you are right. But even so, you lost your parents, don't you feel any sadness in your heart? You should know that from now on, you will be helpless and happy. There is no one to share it with, no one to comfort you when you are sad. Shouldn’t you be sad and cry?"

Tolman II, who was wearing black mourning clothes, replied: "Sir, I understand what you said. What you said is reasonable. But I will not be helpless from now on as you said. Because I am a prophet. Descendants of Lant, our people rely on the power of God, not on human ability. When I am happy, it is God who makes me happy. When I am sad, it is God who makes me sad. Apart from God, Whose strength do I need? One who rejoices with me and comforts my sorrowful heart. Not my father who is burning in the fire, but my Father who is in heaven."

The silver-haired old man said: "I see his shadow in you."

After that, the silver-haired old man ordered his son to take Tolman II to the Island of the Sun and asked him to protect Tolman II until Tolman II came of age.

Tolman II left the seaside after his parents' funeral and walked outside Phoenix City. The Svarthhorsts plotted to capture Tolman II and imprison him.


page 15

Tolman II quickly stepped into the thorns outside Phoenix City and walked out of it. He was unharmed, holding a black snake in his hand, and said to the Svarthhorst people around him who tried to trap him: "Haven't you heard about the phoenix rising from the ashes?"

No one among the Svarthhorst people dared to step forward for fear of being bitten by a snake. Tolman II said: "You are smart enough, but cleverness and lies are more poisonous than snakes. Even so, cleverness and lies cannot save you. I know what you have done, and God also knows. You have committed two crimes. If you make a mistake, you should repent and ask God for forgiveness. Instead of going your own way and committing the third crime. Are you trying to burn all phoenixes? However, phoenixes cannot be burned to death."

A young Svarthhorst man said: "My child, you are talking about a phoenix, so why is it that you are holding a snake in your hand?"

Tolman II, who walked out of the thorns, said: "What you say in your mouth is to distinguish right from wrong, but what you think in your heart is an evil thought that confuses right and wrong."

The Svarthhorst man said: "My child, you are really crazy because of your loss. Where is the phoenix you just mentioned that cannot be burned to death? Why do we only see the snake in your hand?"

Tolman II walked out of the thorns and said: "Don't you see the phoenix I mentioned? I am the scarlet fire phoenix. I am the Tolman II who walked out of the thorns."

Editor's note: Tolman means vermilion.

At this moment, a white horse galloped over. A silver-haired middle-aged man stepped down from the horse. He said to the Svarthhorst people who surrounded Tolman II: "You all stand down. I am Ottvander bar-Salis, the prince of the Sun Empire." I have come at my king's command to take away the sons of Tolman. Because they owe my king a great sum of gold and silver that has not been repaid for a long time, the descendants of Tolman will henceforth be my king's slaves until they repay their debt."

"We will redeem the Son of Tolman with the Storm Isles as payment for his debt," said the Svarthhorst.

The silver-haired Prince Ottvander asked Svarthhorst: "When did God make you gods?"

The Svarthhorst man asked: "May I ask, Your Highness, what do you mean by this?"

The silver-haired Prince Ottvander said: "When did the Storm Island created by God become your property? Is the Storm Island a property that you can give to whomever you want? Are the birds which God created on the Storm Island also your property? Why don't you say, 'We are willing to trade all the birds in the world for the son of Tolman'? Could it be that the sacred land and sea created by the Creator have become the property of your family?"

The Svarthhorsts were speechless and could only let Ottvander take Tolman II away.

The silver-haired Prince Ottvander rescued Tolman II and brought Tolman II to the harbor. The old king of Sun Island was waiting for them there. This old king was the silver-haired old man who talked to Tolman II before the cremation. Ottvander carried Tolman II on his back to the ship and went to Ottvander's hometown, Memphis, where the Salish lived. Tolman II received court education in the palace and could speak the languages ​​of various countries.


Volume 2

Text

In the past, the prophet Lant received God's revelation in a dream, resolutely gave up the throne of the Star Kingdom, and led his people to Phoenixland. At this time, Lant's descendant Tolman II followed the silver-haired Prince Ottvander to Heliosland with the same mission. He grew up in a foreign country and gradually became as great as his father.

When their ship first arrived in Memphis, the silver-haired Prince Ottvander asked Tolman II: "Do you remember what the killers looked like when your parents died? Will you never forget their faces for the rest of your life?"

"No," Tolman II said, "I don't know the appearance of the killer, but I know what my parents looked like when they died. My father was stabbed from the jaw to the head with a sharp weapon, and my mother was pierced through the abdomen with a long sword. There was blood on the ground. And I was not at home when they were killed."

"Thank God. That's why you narrowly escaped death," said Prince Ottvander.
