When there is no such world, God exists. God has no predecessor and has no successor. And God Said: Let there be a realm and it should have a boundary, and I will create a world inside it. Everything in the World that I create will change all the time inside the boundary that I give, until I call this World to end. And there is no time in this World. And God said: The time I created this World is the beginning, and the time I destroy this World is the end. The end is the beginning. and in a glimpse in the midst of it, has infinite time. And therefore, the World has been created.

And God looked below and He saw the sea. And God made earth and the earth descended on the sea, and there are four drops of earth. Every drop of earth became an island. The first drop is the Island of the Sun, Heliosland. God created the Sun, and He called this island Heliosland. The second drop is the land of the stars. God created the Moon and all stars, and He called this island the land of the stars. The third drop of earth is the Island of the Storm. God created the wind and the rain and the thunder and the storm, and He called this island the island of storm. The fourth drop of earth is the Island of Life. God created Life, and He called this island the Island of Life.

The words mentioning the generation of Life:

God said: I have created time, but there is no beings that can feel it. I shall give my great power to the earth. This great power is called the spirit. And the earth which is given the spirit has acquired Life. And God said: I shall store my spirit into the earth, therefore they shall feel the time, and they shall know that I am with them. And after God store His spirit into the earth, the earth has changed its colour, and became vibrant and started growing, and this is called the trees and the herbs. God created the trees and the herbs on the Heliosland, and they became fruitful and covered the land, and their seeds spread to other islands by the wind. And God created all beasts that crawl and creep, and the beasts went to other islands crossing the sea which is frozen. And God created all kinds of fish, and they swam to all rivers and lakes and everywhere in the sea, until the deepest place of the sea. And God created the birds that flies, and they flew to all places. And God created Man on the Island of Life.

God said: I shall make Man and let Man to keep and take care of all the beings that have life inside them, which is on the earth, and in the sky, and in the sea, lest these living creatures die out. And God led the Sons of Man live in all places and blessed them. nevertheless, Man did not keep and take care of all living creatures that God created, and moreover, they did even not keep take take care of their own fellowman, and they hunt and kill and eat each other, between their fellowman and other species. Therefore God said: I have created monsters and I regreted. I shall destroy and sink the Island of Life. Therefore the Island of Life sank. And all living men that live on the Island of Life drown in the sea and died. Only one man and one woman were saved by God, because God love them. God commanded the phoenix to save these two person from drowning, and took them into the Island of the Stars. Amongst the two people that were saved, the man is called Thalifurow, which means the ancient ancestor.

God said: Son of Man, I have sunk the Island of Life, for that island deserves no life. Thou and thy sister were saved by I, because I loved you. Your life do not belongs to the earth, but belongs to I. Your sons shall spread to all the lands and seas, for I selected you to keep and take care of all living creatures that live in the air and on the earth and in the sea, lest these living creatures die out.

When Prophet Lant was born, when the rest of the world was a barbaric land, the Phoenix Kingdom and the Star Kingdom had already been established.

The founding of the Phoenix Kingdom:

To the north of Commercial Port City is Phoenix City, and to the south of Commercial Port City is the Realm of Stars. The road from the Star Kingdom's Imperial City to Phoenix City is called Commercial Port Road. The Nazan and Thorlanders established the Phoenix Kingdom to the north of the commercial port city. The capital of the Phoenix Kingdom is Phoenix City, which was founded by the Svarts. The Svarts are the Svarthhorsts. The Nassan people are the descendants of Nassan, the eldest son of the ancient ancestor Salifro. The Nassan people live in Phoenix and the areas around Phoenix. There are Kahorst, Amberhorst, and Dolethorst. Man and Svarthhorst.

The founding of the Kingdom of Stars:
Scollokast did not migrate from Terra Firma to the Phoenixland region in the north of Star Island, but moved south to live in the Uduria region. Scollokast married Mermaid, a princess of Eudoria, who gave birth to Hipuskas and Strotikas. Hipuskas married Shalimar, daughter of Nilkan, a Solander, and Shalimar gave birth to Kasnafuet. Kasnafuet led the Freistoks and Solanders to attack the Eudorians, defeated the enemy at the town of Vine Bridge, and captured Eudolia. The ancient city of Eudolia is now the imperial city of Star Kingdom. Kasnafuet married Lucia, daughter of Darls of Mosor. Lucia gave birth to Kasulen to Kasnafuet. Kasulen, son of Kasnafuet, married Melka the Nasanite. Melka is a native of Svathost and the daughter of Shinder Svathost II, king of the Phoenix Kingdom. Melka gave birth to Lantikas to Kasulen.

Editor's note: The Mosor people are the descendants of Weestis, the son of Fuman.


The following is the prophecy of the prophet Lant:
God said: "I created humans and ordered humans to guard and take care of all living things. But humans went against my will. So I will destroy the humans living on the Island of Life. Only Salifro and Nova are the ones I love."
Thalifurow and Nova begat Nathan and Kasalot.
Kasalot begat Flastoker.
Flastoker begat Scollokast.
Scollokast begat Hipuskas.
Hipuskas was the father of Kasnafuet.
Kasnafuet begat Kasulen.
Kasulen begot Lantikas. Lantikas is Lant.


The following words were written by this Lant under the inspiration of God.
Scollokast married Momei in Uduria by the sea. Hipuskas, son of Scollokast, knew Eudorian from an early age. Because his mother, Momei, taught him to speak Eudorian. Scollokast had a friend who was Nilkan from Solander. Merme was particularly fond of Nilkan's daughter Sallymar and regarded her as her own daughter. One day, Scollokast's wife Mome asked Nirgan if she could let Sallymar live in her home, and Nirgan agreed. So Princess Eudoria Momei raised Hipuskas and Sallymar. Hypskas, the son of Merme, fell in love with Sallymar, the daughter of Nirgan, and they gave birth to Kasnafoyet. Kasnafuet is a Eudorian word meaning deep blue sea. Scollokast and Nilkan were ministers to King Eudoria. After the death of King Eudoria, Scollokast and Nilkan jointly took over the affairs of state. After the death of Scollokast and Nilkan, the Eudorians were left without a king. Hipuskas, son of Scollokast, was elected king of Eudoria, and his wife Sallymar became queen. Five years after Hipuskas became king of Eudoria, his brother Skrostikas secretly united with the nobles of Eudoria to overthrow his brother and king Hipuskas. Hipuskas and Queen Shalimar were exiled. The Mosor Darls took in Hipuskas and his wife. Darls taught Kasnafuet swordsmanship in his own home. The exiled prince Kasnafuet falls in love with Lucia, the young daughter of the teacher Darls. The exiled prince Kasnafuet was a great hero. After the death of the exiled king Hipuskas, the usurper Skrostikas also died. Kasnafuet led the Flastoker, Solander, and Mosor to defeat the Eudorians in the town of Vine Bridge and capture the city of Eudoria. Eudoria City is now the Imperial City of Star Kingdom. Kasnafuet married Lucia, the daughter of Darls, a native of Mosor, in the imperial city. Kasnafuet and his wife Lucia founded the Star Kingdom.

The once exiled prince now became the first king of the Kingdom of Stars. Lucia gave birth to Kasulen to King Kasnafuet. Kasulen is the second king of the Star Kingdom. He is married to Melka Svathost, the princess of the Phoenix Kingdom. Lant, the son of Kasulen, learned in a dream that the Star Kingdom was about to perish, so he gave up the throne and gave it to Highman Skrostikas, a descendant of the usurper Skrostikas.

In the dream, God told Lant: "Lantikas, son of Cassulan and Melka, after the death of your father Cassulan Hepskas, a violent storm will sweep across the Star Kingdom. If you inherit the throne, you and your brothers will be killed by thieves. The only way out is to give up the throne to Hyman Sklaustikas. Then take your mother Melka Svarthhorst and you brothers leave the Kingdom of Stars. You will go all the way north to the Vinyard manor outside Phoenix City. There, you will meet your future wife: Amberhost Raka (Laka). In Vinyard, you and Laka will have three children. The descendants of this first child will be the monarchs of the Phoenix Kingdom, and the descendants of this second child will be the monarchs of the Sun Island. Monarch, the descendants of this third child will be the monarchs of the islands in the north of the Phoenix Kingdom."

When Lant woke up from his dream, news of the death of his father, King Kasulen, came. He immediately took off his noble clothes and rushed into the temple. When everyone saw the prince's sad expression, they also felt sad.

After burying his father, King Kasulen. Lant said:
"Servants, prepare horses and food now for my mother, my brothers, and me. We are going to the Phoenix Kingdom."
The servants prepared horses for them, and Lant ordered his abdication edict to be read. Afterwards, Lant, his family and servants immediately left the imperial city.

The content of the abdication edict is:
"Lantikas Hipuskas, son of Kasulen Hipuskas and Melka Svathost, is here, by divine revelation Declare that I and my brothers will relinquish the throne of the Kingdom of the Stars and all the fiefs and titles of Eudoria to Highman Skrostikas, the third grandson of Skrostikas. and its heirs. The territory of Eudoria is south of the commercial port city and west of the frozen river."

They continued north along the Commercial Port Road and arrived at the Commercial Port City, Terra Firma, five days later.
In a dream, God revealed to Lant: "Lantikas, son of Cassulan and Melka, you must obey my instructions carefully. You must burn your royal robes. After you arrive in the Phoenix Kingdom, you must not Enter Phoenix so as not to alarm the Svarthhorsts. Stay outside the city at Fynyard Manor. There I have prepared for you my servant Reis the Amberhorst. Reis You will be protected from discovery by the Nasanites or the Solanders.”
Sure enough, they found God's servant Reis in Fenyard. Reis took great care of Melka, Melka's son Lant, and Lant's brothers. Reis knew that Lant was a messenger of God and a prophet inspired by God, and respected him very much. During the reign of King Shinder Svathost V of the Phoenix Kingdom, Reis married his daughter Laka Amberhost to Lant.

Lant planted trees and plowed the fields together with his servants. One day, Lant fell asleep after a day of farming.
In the dream, God said to Lant: "Lantikas, the son of Cassulan and Melka, your wife Laka will bear two sons for you. You must educate these two sons carefully, because they are The founder of all nations. You are to name this first son Ansteras (meaning 'virtuous'), for among his descendants there will be virtuous kings. This second son, you shall name him Sensteras (meaning 'prudent'), for among his descendants there will be humble and noble electors. The descendants of this first son will The Phoenix Kingdom is famous. The descendants of this second son will be the focus of attention in the Kingdom of the Sun. After that, Raqqa will give birth to a third son for you, and you will name him Tiransteras (meaning of Tiransteras is 'distant'), because there is no sea or island that will not leave traces of the voyages of his descendants, even to the ends of the earth. Among his descendants, there will be great navigators."
The above are all God’s revelations to Lant. It was this Lant who wrote these words.
Everything God promised to Lant, God fulfilled.
Since Lant, his mother and brothers moved to the Phoenix Kingdom, Lant has never returned to the Realm of Stars.
