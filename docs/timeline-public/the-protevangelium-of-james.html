The Protevangelium of James
雅各原始福音书
1
1 In the records of the twelve tribes of Israel was Joachim, a man rich exceedingly;
1 在以色列的十二个支派里有一个富有的人，叫若亚敬。

2 and he brought his offerings double, saying: There shall be of my superabundance to all the people, and there shall be the offering for my forgiveness to the Lord for a propitiation for me.
2 他献祭的时候献上双倍，说道：这是对我来说比别人过剩的，所以也必有为我的赦免而献给主的供物，为我作挽回祭。

3 For the great day of the Lord was at hand, and the sons of Israel were bringing their offerings. 
3 因为主的大日子临近了，以色列人带来了他们的供物。

4 And there stood over against him Rubim, saying: It is not meet for you first to bring your offerings, because you have not made seed in Israel.
4 路宾站在他对面，说：“你不宜先献祭物，因为你没有在以色列生养儿女。”

5 And Joachim was exceedingly grieved, and went away to the registers of the twelve tribes of the people, saying: I shall see the registers of the twelve tribes of Israel, as to whether I alone have not made seed in Israel.
5 若亚敬非常伤心，就去查看十二个支派的民籍，说：“我要看看以色列十二个支派的户籍，看看是否只有我一人在以色列没有子嗣。”

6 And he searched, and found that all the righteous had raised up seed in Israel. And he called to mind the patriarch Abraham, that in the last day God gave him a son Isaac.
6 他就翻阅，他发现在以色列所有的义人都有子孙后代。他想起了先祖亚伯拉罕，在他最后的日子里神给了他一个儿子以撒。

7 And Joachim was exceedingly grieved, and did not come into the presence of his wife;
7 若亚敬非常悲伤，他没有到他妻子面前；

8 but he retired to the desert, and there pitched his tent, and fasted forty days and forty nights,
8 而是退到了沙漠，在那里搭起了帐篷，禁食了四十个日夜，
9 saying in himself: I will not go down either for food or for drink until the Lord my God shall look upon me, and prayer shall be my food and drink.
9 他心里说：我就这样下去，不吃也不喝，直到主我的神看顾我，而我的祷告将会成为我所吃的和喝的。






2
1 And his wife Anna mourned in two mournings, and lamented in two lamentations, saying: I shall bewail my widowhood;
1 他的妻子安娜伤痛悲哀，说：我要为我的守寡而哀哭；

2 I shall bewail my childlessness. And the great day of the Lord was at hand;
2 我将为我的无儿无女而哀哭。主的大日子临近了；

3 and Judith her maid-servant said: How long do you humiliate your soul?
3 她的女仆朱迪思说：你还要羞辱你的灵魂到什么时候呢?

4 Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand, and it is unlawful for you to mourn.
4 看哪，主的大日子临近了，你不应该悲哀。

5 But take this head-band, which the woman that made it gave to me;
5 你收下这个束发带，这是一个女人做了给我的；

6 for it is not proper that I should wear it, because I am a maid-servant, and it has a royal appearance.
6 因为我是一个婢女，但它的样子高贵，所以我戴它不合适。

7 And Anna said: Depart from me; for I have not done such things, and the Lord has brought me very low.
7 安娜说：离开我吧；因为我从来没有这样做过，主让我非常卑微。

8 I fear that some wicked person has given it to you, and you have come to make me a sharer in your sin.
8 我怕是某个恶人把它给了你，而你来让我分担你的罪。

9 And Judith said: Why should I curse you, seeing that the Lord has shut your womb, so as not to give you fruit in Israel?
9 朱迪思说：既然主已经关闭了你的子宫，不让你在以色列生育后代，我为什么还要诅咒你呢？
10 And Anna was grieved exceedingly, and put off her garments of mourning, and cleaned her head, and put on her wedding garments, and about the ninth hour went down to the garden to walk.
10 安娜非常悲伤，她脱下她的丧服，洗了头，然后她穿上她的结婚礼服，在大约上午九时去花园里行走。

11 And she saw a laurel, and sat under it, and prayed to the Lord,
11 她看见一棵月桂树，就坐在月桂树下，向主祈祷，

12 saying: O God of our fathers, bless me and hear my prayer, as You did bless the womb of Sarah, and did give her a son Isaac.
12 说：我们祖先的神啊，求你赐福给我，求你垂听我的祷告，就像你赐福给撒拉的子宫，给她一个儿子以撒一样。






3
1 And gazing towards the heaven, she saw a sparrow’s nest in the laurel, and made a lamentation in herself, saying: Alas! who begot me? and what womb produced me?
1 她向天望去，看见桂树上有一个麻雀的窝，心里悲叹道：唉！谁生了我？哪个子宫生下了我？

2 because I have become a curse in the presence of the sons of Israel, and I have been reproached, and they have driven me in derision out of the temple of the Lord.
2 因为我在以色列人面前受咒诅，受辱骂，他们又将我从主的殿里赶出。

3 Alas! to what have I been likened? I am not like the fowls of the heaven, because even the fowls of the heaven are productive before You, O Lord.
3 唉！应该把我比作什么？我不像天上的飞鸟，因为主啊，连天上的飞鸟在你面前也能繁衍。

4 Alas! to what have I been likened? I am not like the beasts of the earth, because even the beasts of the earth are productive before You, O Lord.
4 唉！我应该被比作什么？我不像地上的野兽，因为即使是地上的野兽在你面前也能繁殖，主啊。

5 Alas! to what have I been likened? I am not like these waters, because even these waters are productive before You, O Lord.
5 唉！我应该被比作什么？我不像这些水，因为即使这些水在你面前也能多产，主啊。

6 Alas! to what have I been likened? I am not like this earth, because even the earth brings forth its fruits in season, and blesses You, O Lord.
6 唉！我应该被比作什么？我不像这个大地，因为即使是大地也会按时结出果实，并祝福你，主啊。







4
1 And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood by, saying: Anna, Anna, the Lord has heard your prayer, and you shall conceive, and shall bring forth;
1 这时，主的一位天使站在旁边说：安娜，安娜，主已垂听你的祈祷，你就会怀孕生子；

2 and your seed shall be spoken of in all the world.
2 全世界都会述说你的后代。

3 And Anna said: As the Lord my God lives, if I beget either male or female, I will bring it as a gift to the Lord my God; and it shall minister to Him in holy things all the days of its life.
3 安娜说：我指着永生的主我的神起誓，如果我生出男孩或女孩，我会把他作为礼物献给主我的神；一生一世必事奉他的圣事。

3 And, behold, two angels came, saying to her: Behold, Joachim your husband is coming with his flocks.
3 这时，看哪，两个天使来了，对她说：看哪，你丈夫若亚敬带着他的羊群回来了。

4 For an angel of the Lord went down to him, saying: Joachim, Joachim, the Lord God has heard your prayer Go down hence;
4 主的一位天使下来对他说：若亚敬，若亚敬，主上帝已经听到了你的祈祷，从这里走吧；

5 for, behold, your wife Anna shall conceive.
5 因为，看哪，你的妻子亚拿要怀孕了。

6 And Joachim went down and called his shepherds, saying: Bring me hither ten she-lambs without spot or blemish, and they shall be for the Lord my God;
6 若亚敬就去叫他的牧羊人来，说：把十只没有斑点、没有瑕疵的母羊羔带到这里来，它们要归给主我的神；

7 and bring me twelve tender calves, and they shall be for the priests and the elders; and a hundred goats for all the people.
7 给我牵十二只小牛犊来，给祭司和长老；再给所有人一百只山羊。

8 And, behold, Joachim came with his flocks; and Anna stood by the gate, and saw Joachim coming, and she ran anti hung upon his neck,
8 看啊，若亚敬带着他的羊群来了；安娜站在门口，看到若亚敬来了，她迎着他跑了出去，挂在他的脖子上，

9 saying: Now I know that the Lord God has blessed me exceedingly; for, behold the widow no longer a widow, and I the childless shall conceive. And Joachim rested the first day in his house.
9 说：现在我知道主上帝大大赐福给我；因为，看哪，寡妇不再是寡妇，而我这无儿无女的人也能怀孕。而这天是若亚敬第一天在他的房子里休息。






5
1 And on the following day he brought his offerings, saying in himself:
1 第二天，他带来了供物，心里说：

2 If the Lord God has been rendered gracious to me, the plate on the priest’s forehead will make it manifest to me.
2 如果主上帝向我施恩，祭司额上的牌必向我显明。

3 And Joachim brought his offerings, and observed attentively the priest’s plate when he went up to the altar of the Lord, and he saw no sin in himself.
3 若亚敬带来了他的供品，当他走向主的祭坛时，他仔细观察了祭司的牌，他发现自己没有任何罪。

4 And Joachim said: Now I know that the Lord has been gracious unto me, and has remitted all my sins.
4 若亚敬说：现在我知道主对我很仁慈，赦免了我所有的罪。

5 And he went down from the temple of the Lord justified, and departed to his own house.
5 他既得了义，就出了主的殿，回家去了。

6 And her months were fulfilled, and in the ninth month Anna brought forth.
6 而她的月份在第九个月就满了，安娜就生了。

7 And she said to the midwife: What have I brought forth? and she said: A girl.
7 她对接生婆说：我生了什么？接生婆说：一个女孩。

8 And said Anna: My soul has been magnified this day. And she laid her down.
8 安娜说：我的灵魂在今天得以被颂扬。然后她把她放下来。

9 And the days having been fulfilled, Anna was purified, and gave the breast to the child, and called her name Mary.
9 日子一满，安娜就洁净了，她就给孩子喂奶，给她起名叫玛丽。







6.
1 And the child grew strong day by day; and when she was six months old, her mother set her on the ground to try whether she could stand, and she walked seven steps and came into her bosom;
1 孩子一天天长大，当她六个月大的时候，她母亲把她放在地上，试试她能不能站起来，她走了七步，就到了她怀里。

2 and she snatched her up, saying: As the Lord my God liveth, you shall not walk on this earth until I bring you into the temple of the Lord.
2 她一把抓住她，说道：我指着主我永生的神起誓，除非我带你进入主的圣殿，否则你不得在这地上行走。

3 And she made a sanctuary in her bed-chamber, and allowed nothing common or unclean to pass through her.
3 她在自己的卧室里建立了一个庇护所，不允许任何俗气或不洁的东西穿过她的身体。

4 And she called the undefiled daughters of the Hebrews, and they attended to her.
4 她就召来希伯来人纯洁的女儿们，她们就伺候她。

5 And when she was a year old, Joachim made a great feast, and invited the priests, and the scribes, and the elders, and all the people of Israel.
5 当她一岁的时候，约阿希姆举办了一场盛大的宴会，邀请了祭司、文士、长老和所有以色列人。

6 And Joachim brought the child to the priests; and they blessed her, saying: O God of our fathers, bless this child, and give her an everlasting name to be named in all generations.
6 约阿希姆把孩子带到祭司那里。他们祝福她，说：我们祖先的上帝啊，请保佑这个孩子，赐她一个永恒之名，愿这名流传世世代代。

7 And all the people said: So be it, so be it, amen.
7 众人都说：但愿如此，但愿如此，阿们。

8 And he brought her to the chief priests; and they blessed her, saying: O God most high, look upon this child, and bless her with the utmost blessing, which shall be for ever.
8 他就带她去见祭司长们。他们祝福她，说：至高的上帝啊，请看看这个孩子，并以无上的祝福去祝福她，这祝福将是永远的。

9 And her mother snatched her up, and took her into the sanctuary of her bed-chamber, and gave her the breast.
9 她的母亲把她抱起来，带她到她卧室的圣所里，给她喂奶。

10 And Anna made a song to the Lord God, saying: I will sing a song to the Lord my God, for He has looked upon me, and has taken away the reproach of mine enemies; and the Lord has given the fruit of His righteousness, singular in its kind, and richly endowed before Him.
10 安娜向主上帝唱了一首歌，说道：我要向主我的上帝唱一首歌，因为他注视着我，带走了我敌人的羞辱；主已赐下祂公义的果子，种类奇特，在祂面前是丰盛的。

11 Who will tell the sons of Rubim that Anna gives suck?
11 谁会告诉路宾的儿子们安娜喂奶了？

12 Hear, hear, ye twelve tribes of Israel, that Anna gives suck.
12 听吧，听吧，以色列的十二个支派，安娜喂奶了。

13 And she laid her to rest in the bed-chamber of her sanctuary, and went out and ministered unto them.
13 她把她安放在圣所的卧室里，然后出去侍奉他们。

14 And when the supper was ended, they went down rejoicing, and glorifying the God of Israel.
14 晚餐结束后，他们欢欢喜喜地走了，并赞美以色列的上帝。









7.
1 And her months were added to the child.
1 她的月份也加到了孩子身上。

2 And the child was two years old, and Joachim said: Let us take her up to the temple of the Lord, that we may pay the vow that we have vowed, lest perchance the Lord send to us, and our offering be not received.
2 孩子已经两岁了，约阿希姆说：“让我们带她到主的殿去，我们可以还我们所发的愿，免得主给我们降下什么，以及我们的奉献不被接受。”

3 And Anna said: Let us wait for the third year, in order that the child may not seek for father or mother.
3 安娜说：我们等第三年吧，这样孩子就不会再找父母了。

4 And Joachim said: So let us wait.
4 约阿希姆说：那我们就等待吧。

5 And the child was three years old, and Joachim said: Invite the daughters of the Hebrews that are undefiled, and let them take each a lamp, and let them stand with the lamps burning, that the child may not turn back, and her heart be captivated from the temple of the Lord.
5 孩子三岁了，约阿希姆说：请来那些纯洁的希伯来人的女儿们，让她们每人拿一盏灯，让她们站在灯点着的地方，免得孩子回头，她的心被吸引离开主的圣殿。

6 And they did so until they went up into the temple of the Lord.
6 他们就这样行，直到进了主的殿。

7 And the priest received her, and kissed her, and blessed her, saying: The Lord has magnified your name in all generations.
7 祭司接待了她，亲吻了她，祝福了她，说：“主要世世代代赞美你的名。”

8 In you, on the last of the days, the Lord will manifest His redemption to the sons of Israel.
8 在末时，主将借着你向以色列子民彰显祂的救赎。

9 And he set her down upon the third step of the altar, and the Lord God sent grace upon her; and she danced with her feet, and all the house of Israel loved her.
9 他把她放在祭坛的第三级台阶上，主上帝赐予她恩典。她用脚跳舞，以色列全家都喜爱她。










8.
1 And her parents went down marveling, and praising the Lord God, because the child had not turned back.
1 她的父母下去，心里希奇，赞美主上帝，因为孩子还没有回家。

2 And Mary was in the temple of the Lord as if she were a dove that dwelt there, and she received food from the hand of an angel.
2 玛利亚在主的圣殿里，仿佛是一只栖息在那里的鸽子，她从天使手中接受了食物。

3 And when she was twelve years old there was held a council of the priests, saying: Behold, Mary has reached the age of twelve years in the temple of the Lord.
3 当她十二岁的时候，召开了一次祭司会议，说：看哪，玛丽在主的圣殿里已经满十二岁了。

4 What then shall we do with her, test perchance she defile the sanctuary of the Lord?
4 那么我们应该对她做什么，来考察她是否玷污了主的圣所呢？

5 And they said to the high priest: You stand by the altar of the Lord; go in, and pray concerning her; and whatever the Lord shall manifest unto you, that also will we do.
5 他们对大祭司说：你站在主的坛旁边；进去为她祷告；凡主向你们显明的，我们也必遵行。

6 And the high priest went in, taking the robe with the twelve bells into the holy of holies; and he prayed concerning her.
6 大祭司拿着有十二个铃铛的袍子进去，进入至圣所，为她祈祷。

7 And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him, saying unto him: Zacharias, Zacharias, go out and assemble the widowers of the people, and let them bring each his rod; and to whomsoever the Lord shall show a sign, his wife shall she be.
7 看哪，主的一位天使站在他旁边，对他说：撒迦利亚，撒迦利亚，出去招聚百姓中的鳏夫，让他们各拿自己的杖来；主向谁显一个兆头，谁的妻子就会是她。

8 And the heralds went out through all the circuit of Judea, and the trumpet of the Lord sounded, and all ran.
8 传令官出去走遍犹太各地，主的号角一吹，众人就都跑来。








9.
1 And Joseph, throwing away his axe, went out to meet them; and when they had assembled, they went away to the high priest, taking with them their rods.
1 约瑟丢掉斧头，出去迎接他们。他们聚集后，就带着他们的手杖，去见大祭司。

2 And he, taking the rods of all of them, entered into the temple, and prayed; and having ended his prayer, he took the rods and came out, and gave them to them: but there was no sign in them, and Joseph took his rod last; and, behold, a dove came out of the rod, and flew upon Joseph’s head.
2 他拿着他们所有人的手杖，进入殿里祷告。祷告完了，他就拿着手杖出去，把他们的手杖给他们。但在他们里面没有任何征兆，约瑟最后拿起了手杖。忽然，一只鸽子从手杖中飞出来，飞到约瑟的头上。

3 And the priest said to Joseph, You have been chosen by lot to take into your keeping the virgin of the Lord.
3 祭司对约瑟说，你是抽签选出的，可以收留主的童女。

4 But Joseph refused, saying: I have children, and I am an old man, and she is a young girl. I am afraid lest I become a laughing-stock to the sons of Israel.
4 但约瑟夫拒绝了，他说：我有孩子，我是个老人，而她是个年轻女孩。我担心我会成为以色列人的笑柄。

5 And the priest said to Joseph: Fear the Lord your God, and remember what the Lord did to Dathan, and Abiram, and Korah; how the earth opened, and they were swallowed up on account of their contradiction.
5 祭司对约瑟说：要敬畏主你的神，记念主向大坍、亚比兰、可拉所行的事；大地如何裂开，而他们却因他们的矛盾而被吞没。

6 And now fear, O Joseph, lest the same things happen in your house.
6 约瑟夫啊，你现在要害怕，以免同样的事情发生在你家里。

7 And Joseph was afraid, and took her into his keeping.
7 约瑟害怕了，就收留了她，亲自照顾她。

8 And Joseph said to Mary: Behold, I have received you from the temple of the Lord; and now I leave you in my house, and go away to build my buildings, and I shall come to you. The Lord will protect you.
8 约瑟对马利亚说：看哪，我已经从主的殿里收下你了；现在你留在我家，我要离开你去建造我的建筑物，之后我会来找你。主会保护你。








10.
1 And there was a council of the priests, saying: Let us make a veil for the temple of the Lord.
1 祭司们开了一个会议，说：我们要为主的殿造幔子。

2 And the priest said: Call to me the undefiled virgins of the family of David.
2 祭司说：给我把大卫家族的那些纯洁的童女召来。

3 And the officers went away, and sought, and found seven virgins.
3 差役们就出去寻找，就找着七个童女。

4 And the priest remembered the child Mary, that she was of the family of David, and undefiled before God.
4 祭司想起了小马利亚，她是大卫家族的人，在上帝面前是纯洁无瑕的。

5 And the officers went away and brought her. And they brought them into the temple of the Lord.
5 差役们就去把她带了过来。他们就把童女们带进主的殿里。

6 And the priest said: Choose for me by lot who shall spin the gold, and the white, and the fine linen, and the silk, and the blue, and the scarlet, and the true purple.
6 祭司说：“用抽签的方式为我选出谁来纺金线、白色线、细麻线、丝绸线、蓝色线、朱红色线和正紫色线。”

7 And the true purple and the scarlet fell to the lot of Mary, and she took them, and went away to her house.
7 正紫色和朱红色的签子落到了玛丽的手中，她拿着这些颜色的线，回家了。

8 And at that time Zacharias was dumb, and Samuel was in his place until the time that Zacharias spoke.
8 当时撒迦利亚哑了，直到撒迦利亚开口说话之前，撒母耳都在他的位置上。

9 And Mary took the scarlet, and span it.
9 玛丽拿起朱红色的线，开始纺它。








11.
1 And she took the pitcher, and went out to fill it with water.
1 她就拿起水罐，出去打满水。

2 And, behold, a voice saying: Hail, you who has received grace; the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!
2 这时，有一个声音说：万岁，你这领受恩典的人；主与你同在；你在妇女中是有福的！

3 And she looked round, on the right hand and on the left, to see whence this voice came.
3 她环顾四周，左顾右盼，想弄清楚这个声音是从哪里来的。

4 And she went away, trembling, to her house, and put down the pitcher; and taking the purple, she sat down on her seat, and drew it out.
4 她颤抖着回到自己的家，放下水罐。她拿着紫色的纺线，坐下了，把线抽出来。

5 And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood before her, saying: Fear not, Mary; for you have found grace before the Lord of all, and you shall conceive, according to His word.
5 看哪，主的一位天使站在她面前说：不要害怕，玛丽；因为你们在万有之主面前已蒙恩，就必照着祂的话怀孕。

6 And she hearing, reasoned with herself, saying: Shall I conceive by the Lord, the living God? and shall I bring forth as every woman brings forth?
6 她听了，心里思索说：我真能靠着主永生的神怀孕吗？我应该像每个女人那样生育吗？

7 And the angel of the Lord said: Not so, Mary; for the power of the Lord shall overshadow you: wherefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of the Most High.
7 主的天使说：玛丽，不是那样；因为主的能力必荫庇你。因此，从你而生的圣者必被称为至高者的儿子。

8 And you shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins.
8 你要给他起名叫耶稣，因为祂要将祂的子民从罪恶中拯救出来。

9 And Mary said: Behold, the servant of the Lord before His face: let it be unto me according to your word.
9 马利亚说：看哪，主的仆人正在祂的面前：愿这事照你的话在我身上成就。








12.
1 And she made the purple and the scarlet, and took them to the priest.
1 她纺好了紫色和朱红色的线，拿到祭司那里。

2 And the priest blessed her, and said: Mary, the Lord God has magnified your name, and you shall be blessed in all the generations of the earth.
2 祭司祝福她，说：玛利亚，主神已赞美你的名，你将被地上的万代所祝福。

3 And Mary, with great joy, went away to Elizabeth her kinswoman, and knocked at the door.
3 玛丽就大大喜乐，她走到她的亲戚伊丽莎白那里，敲了门。

4 And when Elizabeth heard her, she threw away the scarlet, and ran to the door, and opened it; and seeing Mary, she blessed her, and said:
4 伊丽莎白一听见她的声音，就扔掉了红色的衣服，跑到门口，打开了门。她看见玛利亚，就祝福她，说：

5 Whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? for, behold, that which is in me leaped and blessed you.
5 我主的母亲到我这里来，是从哪里来的呢？我心里那按捺不住的声音由衷地祝福你。

6 But Mary had forgotten the mysteries of which the archangel Gabriel had spoken, and gazed up into heaven, and said:
6 但玛利亚忘记了先前大天使加百列所说的奥秘，她抬头望天说：

7 Who am I, O Lord, that all the generations of the earth should bless me?
7 主啊，我到底是谁，以至于地上的万代都要祝福我？

8 And she remained three months with Elizabeth; and day by day she grew bigger.
8 她和伊丽莎白待了三个月。她的肚子一天天变大。

9 And Mary being afraid, went away to her own house, and hid herself from the sons of Israel.
9 马利亚就害怕，就回家去，躲避以色列人。

10 And she was sixteen years old when these mysteries happened.
10 这些奇事发生在她十六岁的时候。








13.
1 And she was in her sixth month; and, behold, Joseph came back from his building, and, entering into his house, he discovered that she was big with child.
1 当时她怀胎已有六个月了。这时候，约瑟建造完房子回来，他进了家门，发现她已经怀孕了。

2 And he smote his face, and threw himself on the ground upon the sackcloth, and wept bitterly, saying:
2 他就打自己的脸，扑倒在地，披上麻衣，痛哭起来，说：

3 With what face shall I look upon the Lord my God? and what prayer shall I make about this maiden? because I received her a virgin out of the temple of the Lord, and I have not watched over her.
3 “我当以什么脸面来见主我的神呢？我该为这位少女祈祷什么？因为我从主的殿里收留她的时候她还是一个处女，而我却没有看顾好她。”

4 Who is it that has hunted me down?
4 到底是谁在暗中害我？

5 Who has done this evil thing in my house, and defiled the virgin?
5 是谁在我家里做了这件邪恶的事，玷污了这处女？

6 Has not the history of Adam been repeated in me?
6 亚当的历史岂不是在我身上重演了吗？

7 For just as Adam was in the hour of his singing praise, and the serpent came, and found Eve alone, and completely deceived her, so it has happened to me also.
7 因为正如在亚当正唱着赞美诗之时，那蛇来了，发现夏娃独自一人，就彻底欺骗了她，这悲剧又在我身上重演了。

8 And Joseph stood up from the sackcloth, and called Mary, and said to her:
8 约瑟从麻衣之中站了起来，他把马利亚叫来，对她说：

9 O you who have been cared for by God, why have you done this and forgotten the Lord your God?
9 “你这蒙上帝看顾的人啊，为什么要做这事，忘记主你的上帝呢？”

10 Why have you brought low your soul, you that were brought up in the holy of holies, and that received food from the hand of an angel?
10 你这个在至圣所中长大、从天使手中领受食物的人，为什么要卑贱自己的灵魂呢？

11 And she wept bitterly, saying: I am innocent, and have known no man.
11 她痛哭着说：我是无辜的，我没接触过任何男人。

12 And Joseph said to her: Whence then is that which is in your womb?
12 约瑟对她说：“那么，你腹中的胎是从哪里来的呢？”

13 And she said: As the Lord my God lives, I do not know whence it is to me.
13 她说：“我指着永生的主我的神起誓，我不知道它是从哪里来的。”







14.
1 And Joseph was greatly afraid, and retired from her, and considered what he should do in regard to her.
1 约瑟非常恐惧，就离开她，思考该如何处置她。

2 And Joseph said: If I conceal her sin, I find myself fighting against the law of the Lord; and if I expose her to the sons of Israel, I am afraid lest that which is in her be from an angel, and I shall be found giving up innocent blood to the doom of death.
2 约瑟心里说：如果我隐瞒她的罪，我就违背了主的律法；如果我告发她，把她交给以色列人，我担心她身上所怀的胎是来自天使，我就会因叫无辜者流血而被定死罪。

3 What then shall I do with her? I will put her away from me secretly.
3 如此，我该怎么处置她呢？我就叫她偷偷地离开我吧。

4 And night came upon him; and, behold, an angel of the Lord appears to him in a dream, saying:
4 夜幕降临了；看哪，主的天使在梦中向他显现，说：

5 Be not afraid for this maiden, for that which is in her is of the Holy Spirit; and she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.
5 不要为这少女的事而惧怕，因为她所怀的乃是来自圣灵；她会生下一个男婴，你要给他起名叫耶稣，因为祂要将祂的子民从罪恶中拯救出来。

6 And Joseph arose from sleep, and glorified the God of Israel, who had given him this grace; and he kept her.
6 约瑟从梦中醒来，就赞美那位赐他这恩典的以色列的神。于是他留住了她。








15.
1 And Annas the scribe came to him, and said: Why have you not appeared in our assembly?
1 文士亚那前来对他说：你为什么没有出现在我们的聚会中呢？

2 And Joseph said to him: Because I was weary from my journey, and rested the first day.
2 约瑟对他说：“我因旅途劳累，头一日就休息了。”

3 And he turned, and saw that Mary was with child.
3 他转过身来，看见玛丽怀孕了。

4 And he ran away to the priest, and said to him: Joseph, whom you did vouch for, has committed a grievous crime.
4 然后他就跑去找到祭司，对他说：你所担保的约瑟犯下大罪了。

5 And the priest said: How so?
5 祭司说：怎么回事？

6 And he said: He has defiled the virgin whom he received out of the temple of the Lord, and has married her by stealth, and has not revealed it to the sons of Israel.
6 他说：他玷污了他从主的殿里所收下的童贞女，并偷偷地娶了她，但他没有将这事告诉以色列人。

7 And the priest answering, said: Has Joseph done this?
7 祭司回答说：约瑟真的做了这样的事？

8 Then said Annas the scribe: Send officers, and you wilt find the virgin with child.
8 文士亚那就说：遣差役过去，你就会发现那处女怀了孩子了。

9 And the officers went away, and found it as he had said; and they brought her along with Joseph to the tribunal.
9 差役就去了，所见正如他所说的。他们就把她和约瑟夫一起带过来审问。

10 And the priest said: Mary, why have you done this? and why have you brought your soul low, and forgotten the Lord your God?
10 祭司就说：玛丽，你为什么做这种事？你为何要贬低自己的灵魂，忘记主你的神呢？

11 You that were reared in the holy of holies, and that did receive food from the hand of an angel, and did hear the hymns, and did dance before Him, why have you done this?
11 你这在至圣所中长大的人，是从天使手中领受过食物的，又听过赞美诗，还在祂面前跳过舞，你怎么会做了这种事？

12 And she wept bitterly, saying: As the Lord my God lives, I am pure before Him, and know not a man.
12 她痛哭着说：我指着永生的主我的神起誓，我在祂面前是清白的，我没有接触过任何男人。

13 And the priest said to Joseph: Why have you done this?
13 祭司就对约瑟说：你为什么做了这种事？

14 And Joseph said: As the Lord lives, I am pure concerning her.
14 约瑟说：我指着永生的主起誓，我和她之间是清白的。

15 Then said the priest: Bear not false witness, but speak the truth.
15 祭司就说：不要作假见证，要说实话。

16 You have married her by stealth, and have not revealed it to the sons of Israel, and have not bowed your head under the strong hand, that your seed might be blessed.
16 你偷偷地娶了她，没有将这事告诉以色列人，而在这权威面前，这能让你的子孙蒙福的权威面前，你怎么还不低头？

17 And Joseph was silent.
17 约瑟夫沉默了。








16.
1 And the priest said: Give up the virgin whom you did receive out of the temple of the Lord.
1 祭司说：把那个你从主的殿里所领受的处女交出来。

2 And Joseph burst into tears.
2 约瑟夫泪流满面。

3 And the priest said: I will give you to drink of the water of the ordeal of the Lord, and He shall make manifest your sins in your eyes.
3 祭司说：我要给你喝主的裁决之水，他会在你眼前显明你的罪孽。

4 And the priest took the water, and gave Joseph to drink and sent him away to the hill-country; and he returned unhurt.
4 祭司取水给约瑟喝，然后打发他往山地去。他毫发无伤地回来了。

5 And he gave to Mary also to drink, and sent her away to the hill-country; and she returned unhurt.
5 然后他也给马利亚喝了，然后也打发她往山地去。她也毫发无伤地回来了。

6 And all the people wondered that sin did not appear in them.
6 所有人都惊讶在他们身上没有显出罪来。

7 And the priest said: If the Lord God has not made manifest your sins, neither do I judge you. And he sent them away.
7 祭司就说：如果主神没有显明你们的罪孽，那么我也不审判你们。他就叫他们走了。

8 And Joseph took Mary, and went away to his own house, rejoicing and glorifying the God of Israel.
8 约瑟就欢喜地带着马利亚回了他自己的家，并将荣耀归给以色列的神。








17.
1 And there was an order from the Emperor Augustus, that all in Bethlehem of Judaea should be enrolled.
1 奥古斯都皇帝下令，所有犹太伯利恒的人都应该被登记。

2 And Joseph said: I shall enroll my sons, but what shall I do with this maiden? How shall I enroll her?
2 约瑟说：“我要给我的儿子们登记，然而对于这个少女我该怎么做呢？给她报名的时候我该如何称呼她呢？”

3 As my wife? I am ashamed.
3 称为我的妻子？我很羞愧。

4 As my daughter then? But all the sons of Israel know that she is not my daughter.
4 那么称为我的女儿呢？可是所有以色列人都知道她不是我的女儿。

5 The day of the Lord shall itself bring it to pass as the Lord will.
5 然而这日子是主的，主的日子如何过，要按照主的旨意。

6 And he saddled the ass, and set her upon it; and his son led it, and Joseph followed.
6 他给驴备上鞍，让她骑上。他的儿子在前面牵着驴，约瑟跟在后面。

7 And when they had come within three miles, Joseph turned and saw her sorrowful; and he said to himself: Likely that which is in her distresses her.
7 他们行着，还有不到三里的时候，约瑟夫转过身来，看到她悲伤不已。他对自己说：应该是那她所怀的让她感到痛苦。

8 And again Joseph turned and saw her laughing.
8 约瑟夫再次转过身来，看到她在笑。

9 And he said to her: Mary, how is it that I see in your face at one time laughter, at another sorrow?
9 他就对她说：玛丽，我怎么在你的脸上时而看到欢笑，时而看到悲伤？

10 And Mary said to Joseph: Because I see two peoples with my eyes; the one weeping and lamenting, and the other rejoicing and exulting.
10 玛利亚对约瑟说：因为我亲眼看到两个人；一个人在哭泣哀叹，另一个人则欢欣鼓舞。

11 And they came into the middle of the road, and Mary said to him: Take me down from off the ass, for that which is in me presses to come forth.
11 他们行着，到了半路，玛丽对他说：抱我从驴上下来，因为我身上所怀的急迫地要出来。

12 And he took her down from off the ass, and said to her: Whither shall I lead you, and cover your disgrace? for the place is desert.
12 他把她从驴上抱下来，对她说：我该带你到哪里去，以掩饰你的耻辱呢？因为这个地方是沙漠。










18.
1 And he found a cave there, and led her into it; and leaving his two sons beside her, he went out to seek a midwife in the district of Bethlehem.
1 他在那里找到一个山洞，就把她领进去。他把两个儿子留在她身边，出去到伯利恒地区寻找助产士。

2 And I Joseph was walking, and was not walking; and I looked up into the sky, and saw the sky astonished; and I looked up to the pole of the heavens, and saw it standing, and the birds of the air keeping still.
2 我约瑟正在行走，却没在行走；我抬头望向天空，看到天空静止了；我抬头望向天国的支柱，看见它矗立在那儿，天上的飞鸟也都静止不动。

3 And I looked down upon the earth, and saw a trough lying, and work-people reclining: and their hands were in the trough.
3 我向下俯视大地，看到那儿平放着一个饭槽，工人们就躺在那儿不动：他们的手也一动不动地在槽里。

4 And those that were eating did not eat, and those that were rising did not carry it up, and those that were conveying anything to their mouths did not convey it; but the faces of all were looking upwards.
4 那些正在吃的人并没有吃，那些正在起来的人也没有起来，那些正在喂东西到他们嘴里的人也并没有喂。但是所有人的脸都在向上看。

5 And I saw the sheep walking, and the sheep stood still; and the shepherd raised his hand to strike them, and his hand remained up.
5 我看见羊正在走着，但羊却静止不动；而牧羊人举起了手要打牠们，但他的手仍然举着不动。

6 And I looked upon the current of the river, and I saw the mouths of the kids resting on the water and not drinking, and all things in a moment were driven from their course.
6 我又俯看那河水的湍流，我看到孩子们的嘴都贴在水面上，却没在喝，一切事物都在一瞬间被移出了他们的进程。








19.
1 And I saw a woman coming down from the hill-country, and she said to me: O man, where are you going?
1 我看见一个女人从山地过来，她对我说：哦，男人，你要去哪里？

2 And I said: I am seeking an Hebrew midwife.
2 我说：我正在寻找希伯来助产士。

3 And she answered and said unto me: Are you of Israel? And I said to her: Yes.
3 她回答我说：你是以色列人吗？我对她说：是的。

4 And she said: And who is it that is bringing forth in the cave?
4 她说：那么，在山洞里生孩子的是谁呢？

5 And I said: A woman betrothed to me.
5 我说：一个与我订了婚的女人。

6 And she said to me: Is she not your wife?
6 她对我说：她不是你的妻子吗？

7 And I said to her: It is Mary that was reared in the temple of the Lord, and I obtained her by lot as my wife. And yet she is not my wife, but has conceived of the Holy Spirit.
7 我对她说：玛利亚是在主的圣殿里长大的，我是通过抽签得到她作为我的妻子的。然而她不是我的妻子，而是受了圣灵的孕。

8 And the midwife said to him: Is this true?
8 接生婆对他说：这是真的吗？

9 And Joseph said to her: Come and see. And the midwife went away with him.
9 约瑟夫对她说：你自己来看吧。接生婆就跟着他走了。

10 And they stood in the place of the cave, and behold a luminous cloud overshadowed the cave.
10 他们站在山洞的地方，看到一片发光的云彩笼罩着山洞。

11 And the midwife said: My soul has been magnified this day, because mine eyes have seen strange things — because salvation has been brought forth to Israel.
11 接生婆说：我的灵魂已在今日被赞美，因为我的眼睛看到了奇事 — 因为救恩已经降临到以色列了。

12 And immediately the cloud disappeared out of the cave, and a great light shone in the cave, so that the eyes could not bear it.
12 而旋即云朵就消失在了山洞之外，山洞内闪烁着巨大的光芒，让人眼睛无法忍受。

13 And in a little that light gradually decreased, until the infant appeared, and went and took the breast from His mother Mary.
13 过了一会儿，那光逐渐减弱，直到婴儿出现，并从他的母亲玛丽亚那里哺乳。

14 And the midwife cried out, and said: This is a great day to me, because I have seen this strange sight.
14 接生婆大声喊道：这对我来说是伟大的一天，因为我看到了这异象。

15 And the midwife went forth out of the cave, and Salome met her.
15 接生婆走出山洞，这时撒罗米遇到了她。

16 And she said to her: Salome, Salome, I have a strange sight to relate to you: a virgin has brought forth — a thing which her nature admits not of.
16 她对她说：撒罗米，撒罗米，我有一个异象要告诉你：一个处女生了孩子，这是她的本性所不允许的一件事。

17 Then said Salome: As the Lord my God lives, unless I thrust in my finger, and search the parts, I will not believe that a virgin has brought forth.
17 撒罗米说：“我指着主我永生的神起誓，除非我把手指伸进去，检查那些部位，否则我不会相信有童女怀孕生子。”








20.
1 And the midwife went in, and said to Mary: Show yourself; for no small controversy has arisen about you.
1 接生婆进去对马利亚说：显示你自己吧！因为你引起了不小的争议。

2 And Salome put in her finger, and cried out, and said: Woe is me for mine iniquity and mine unbelief, because I have tempted the living God; and, behold, my hand is dropping off as if burned with fire.
2 撒罗米把手指伸进去，大声喊道：“我有祸了，因为我的罪孽和我的不信，因为我试探了永生上帝。看哪，我的手好像被火烧焦了一样，快要掉下来了。

3 And she bent her knees before the Lord, saying: O God of my fathers, remember that I am the seed of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; do not make a show of me to the sons of Israel, but restore me to the poor;
3 她在主面前跪下说：我祖宗的神啊，求你记念我是亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的后裔；求你不要向以色列人炫耀我，而要使我归于贫穷人。

4 for You know, O Lord, that in Thy name I have performed my services, and that I have received my reward at Thy hand.
4 因为你知道，主啊，我以你的名义履行了我的职责，并且我从你手中得到了我的奖赏。

5 And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood by her, saying to her: Salome, Salome, the Lord has heard you.
5 这时，看哪，主的一位天使站在她旁边，对她说：撒罗米，撒罗米，主已经垂听了。

6 Put your hand to the infant, and carry it, and you will have safety and joy.
6 把你的手放在婴儿身上，抱着他，你就会有平安和喜乐。

7 And Salome went and carried it, saying: I will worship Him, because a great King has been born to Israel.
7 撒罗米去抱了它，说：我要敬拜他，因为以色列诞生了一位伟大的君王。

8 And, behold, Salome was immediately cured, and she went forth out of the cave justified.
8 看哪，撒罗米立刻痊愈了，她就得了义，走出了山洞。

9 And behold a voice saying: Salome, Salome, tell not the strange things you have seen, until the child has come into Jerusalem.
9 这时，有一个声音说：撒罗米，撒罗米，在这孩子进到耶路撒冷之前，不要说起你所看到的奇事。









21.
1 And, behold, Joseph was ready to go into Judea.
1 看哪，约瑟准备前往犹太。

2 And there was a great commotion in Bethlehem of Judea, for Magi came, saying: Where is he that is born king of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.
2 犹太的伯利恒发生了一场巨大的骚乱，因为贤士们来了，问道：那个生来就是犹太人的王的人在哪里？因为我们在东方看见了他的星，特来拜他。

3 And when Herod heard, he was much disturbed, and sent officers to the Magi.
3 希律王听了，非常不安，就派军官去见贤士。

4 And he sent for the priests, and examined them, saying: How is it written about the Christ? where is He to be born?
4 他就派人去请祭司们来，询问他们，说：关于基督，经上是怎样写的呢？他将在哪里出生？

5 And they said: In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written.
5 他们说：在犹太的伯利恒，因为经上是这样写的。

6 And he sent them away. And he examined the Magi, saying to them: What sign have you seen in reference to the king that has been born?
6 他就把祭司们打发走了。然后他就询问贤士们，对他们说：关于这位已诞生的国王，你们看到了什么征兆？

7 And the Magi said: We have seen a star of great size shining among these stars, and obscuring their light, so that the stars did not appear; and we thus knew that a king has been born to Israel, and we have come to worship him.
7 贤士们说：我们看到一颗巨大的星在众星中闪耀，遮蔽了它们的光芒，使众星都看不见了；因此我们知道以色列诞生了一位王，我们特来敬拜他。

8 And Herod said: Go and seek him; and if you find him, let me know, in order that I also may go and worship him.
8 希律说：去寻找他吧！如果你们找到了他，就禀告我，这样我也好去敬拜他。

9 And the Magi went out. And, behold, the star which they had seen in the east went before them until they came to the cave, and it stood over the top of the cave.
9 贤士们就出去了。这时，看哪，他们在东方看到的那颗星在他们前面行进，直到他们来到洞前，那颗星就停在洞的上方。
10 And the Magi saw the infant with His mother Mary; and they brought forth from their bag gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
10 贤士们看到了婴儿和他的母亲玛丽；他们从袋子里拿出黄金、乳香和没药。

11 And having been warned by the angel not to go into Judea, they went into their own country by another road.
11 天使警告他们不要进入犹太，他们就从另一条路回了自己的国家。








22.
1 And when Herod knew that he had been mocked by the Magi, in a rage he sent murderers, saying to them: Slay the children from two years old and under.
1 当希律得知他被东方博士嘲弄了之后，他一怒之下派出了杀手们，吩咐他们说：杀掉所有两岁及以下的孩子。

2 And Mary, having heard that the children were being killed, was afraid, and took the infant and swaddled Him, and put Him into an ox-stall.
2 玛利亚听说有孩子们被杀了，很害怕，就把婴儿抱起来，裹在襁褓里，放进牛厩里。

3 And Elizabeth, having heard that they were searching for John, took him and went up into the hill-country, and kept looking where to conceal him. And there was no place of concealment.
3 伊丽莎白一听说他们在寻找约翰，就带着他进了山地，寻找可以藏他的地方。然而没有任何可藏的地方。

4 And Elizabeth, groaning with a loud voice, says: O mountain of God, receive mother and child.
4 伊丽莎白大声呻吟着说：上帝之山啊，请接纳母亲和孩子。

5 And immediately the mountain was cleft, and received her.
5 山立刻裂开，接纳了她。

6 And a light shone about them, for an angel of the Lord was with them, watching over them.
6 有一道光照亮了他们，因为主的天使与他们同在，看顾着他们。








23.
1 And Herod searched for John, and sent officers to Zacharias, saying: Where have you hidden your son?
1 希律寻找约翰，又派差役去见撒迦利亚，说：你把你的儿子藏在哪里了？

2 And he, answering, said to them: I am the servant of God in holy things, and I sit constantly in the temple of the Lord: I do not know where my son is.
2 他回答说：“我在圣事上是神的仆人，我常坐在主的殿里，我不知道我的儿子在哪里。”

3 And the officers went away, and reported all these things to Herod. And Herod was enraged, and said: His son is destined to be king over Israel.
3 差役就去，将这一切事告诉希律。希律王勃然大怒，说：他的儿子注定要成为以色列的王。

4 And he sent to him again, saying: Tell the truth; where is your son? for you know that your life is in my hand.
4 又遣人去，对他说：说实话；你的儿子在哪里？因为你知道你的命在我手里。

5 And Zacharias said: I am God’s martyr, if you shed my blood; for the Lord will receive my spirit, because you shed innocent blood at the vestibule of the temple of the Lord.
5 撒迦利亚说：如果你流我的血，我就是上帝的殉道者；而主必接纳我的灵魂，因为你们在主的殿的前厅流了无辜人的血。

6 And Zacharias was murdered about daybreak. And the sons of Israel did not know that he had been murdered.
6 撒迦利亚在黎明时分被杀害了。以色列人不知道他被杀害了。









24.
1 But at the hour of the salutation the priests went away, and Zacharias did not come forth to meet them with a blessing, according to his custom.
1 到了问安的时候，祭司们要走了，这次撒迦利亚没有按照惯例出来与他们相会并祝福他们。

2 And the priests stood waiting for Zacharias to salute him at the prayer, and to glorify the Most High.
2 祭司们站着等待撒迦利亚，为了在祷告时向他问安，并荣耀至高者。

3 And he still delaying, they were all afraid.
3 而他还在拖延，他们都害怕了。

4 But one of them ventured to go in, and he saw clotted blood beside the altar; and he heard a voice saying:
4 但其中一个人壮着胆子进去，看见祭坛旁边有一滩血迹；他听到一个声音说：

5 Zacharias has been murdered, and his blood shall not be wiped up until his avenger come.
5 撒迦利亚被谋杀了，而在那位为他复仇的人到来之前，他的血不会被抹去。

6 And hearing this saying, he was afraid, and went out and told it to the priests.
6 他听见这话，就害怕，就出去告诉祭司们。

7 And they ventured in, and saw what had happened; and the fretwork of the temple made a wailing noise, and they rent their clothes from the top even to the bottom.
7 他们冒险进去，看看发生了什么事。神殿的雕花发出哀号声，它们的装饰从上到下都撕裂了。

8 And they found not his body, but they found his blood turned into stone.
8 他们没有找到他的尸体，但发现他的血变成了石头。

9 And they were afraid, and went out and reported to the people that Zacharias had been murdered.
9 他们很害怕，就出去告诉百姓，撒迦利亚被杀了。

10 And all the tribes of the people heard, and mourned, and lamented for him three days and three nights.
10 各支派的人听见了，都为他哀哭三天三夜。

11 And after the three days, the priests consulted as to whom they should put in his place; and the lot fell upon Simeon.
11 三天之后，祭司们商议该选谁来接替他的位置。抽签落在西缅身上。

12 For it was he who had been warned by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death until he should see the Christ in the flesh.
12 因为他受到圣灵的警告，除非他看到肉身的基督，否则他不会看到死亡。









1 And I James that wrote this history in Jerusalem, a commotion having arisen when Herod died, withdrew myself to the wilderness until the commotion in Jerusalem ceased, glorifying the Lord God, who had given me the gift and the wisdom to write this history.
1 我是在耶路撒冷写下这段历史的雅各，希律死后，发生了一场骚乱，我退到旷野，直到耶路撒冷的骚乱停止，荣耀主上帝，他给了我写这段历史的恩赐和智慧。

2 And grace shall be with them that fear our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory to ages of ages. Amen.
2 而恩典必临到敬畏我们的主耶稣基督的人，愿荣耀归给祂，直到永远。阿们。











Infancy Gospel of Thomas
多马婴儿福音

1
I, Thomas the Israelite, tell unto you, even all the brethren that are of the Gentiles, to make known unto you the works of the childhood of our Lord Jesus Christ and his mighty deeds, even all that he did when he was born in our land: whereof the beginning is thus:

1
我，以色列人多马，告诉你们，就是所有的外邦弟兄，要叫你们知道我们的主耶稣基督幼年时的作为，和他的大能事迹，就是他出生在我们的土地上时所做的一切。其起初是这样的:



2
This child Jesus, when five years old, was playing in the ford of a mountain stream; and He collected the flowing waters into pools, and made them clear immediately, and by a word alone He made them obey Him. And having made some soft clay, He fashioned out of it twelve sparrows. And it was the Sabbath when He did these things. And there were also many other children playing with Him. And a certain Jew, seeing what Jesus was doing, playing on the Sabbath, went off immediately, and said to his father Joseph: Behold, thy son is at the stream, and has taken clay, and made of it twelve birds, and has profaned the Sabbath. And Joseph, coming to the place and seeing, cried out to Him, saying: Wherefore doest thou on the Sabbath what it is not lawful to do? And Jesus clapped His hands, and cried out to the sparrows, and said to them: Off you go! And the sparrows flew, and went off crying. And the Jews seeing this were amazed, and went away and reported to their chief men what they had seen Jesus doing.

2
耶稣五岁时，正在山涧的浅滩玩耍。他把流水聚成池子，立刻就使它们清澈，只用一句话就使他们服从了他。他和了一些软土，用它捏出了十二只麻雀。他做这些事的时候正是安息日。还有许多其他的孩子和他一起玩耍。有一个犹太人，看见耶稣在安息日所做的事，就立刻去对他父亲约瑟说：看哪，你儿子在溪边，拿泥捏了十二只鸟，做了十二只鸟。亵渎了安息日。约瑟到了那地方，看见了，就喊着说：“为什么你在安息日作不许做的事呢？”耶稣拍手，向麻雀喊叫说：你们走吧！麻雀飞了，啼叫着走了。犹太人看见这事就希奇，就去将所看见耶稣所做的事报告给他们的首领。



3
And the son of Annas the scribe was standing there with Joseph; and he took a willow branch, and let out the waters which Jesus bad collected. And Jesus, seeing what was done, was angry, and said to him: O wicked, impious, and foolish! what harm did the pools and the waters do to thee? Behold, even now thou shalt be dried up like a tree, and thou shalt not bring forth either leaves, or root, or fruit. And straightway that boy was quite dried up. And Jesus departed, and went to Joseph's house. But the parents of the boy that had been dried up took him up, bewailing his youth, and brought him to Joseph, and reproached him because, said they, thou hast such a child doing such things.

3
文士亚那的儿子和约瑟一同站在那里。他拿起一根柳枝，把耶稣收集的水放了出来。耶稣看见所发生的事，就生气，对他说：“你这邪恶的、不敬虔的、愚昧的人哪！水池和水对你造成了什么伤害？看哪，现在你必像一棵树一样枯干，不能长出叶子，不能长出根，也不能长出果子。那男孩立刻就干瘪了。耶稣就起身往约瑟的家里去。但是那个已经干涸的男孩的父母却把他抱起来，哀叹他的年轻，把他带到约瑟那里，并责备他，因为他们说，你有这样一个孩子做这样的事。



4
After that He was again passing through the village; and a boy ran up against Him, and struck His shoulder. And Jesus was angry, and said to him: Thou shalt not go back the way thou camest. And immediately he fell down dead. And some who saw what had taken place, said: Whence was this child begotten, that every word of his is certainly accomplished? And the parents of the dead boy went away to Joseph, and blamed him, saying: Since thou hast such a child, it is impossible for thee to live with us in the village; or else teach him to bless, and not to curse: for he is killing our children.

4
此后，他再次经过这个村庄。一个男孩向他跑去，打他的肩膀。耶稣很生气，对他说：你不可按原路回去。他立刻就倒地死了。有的看见这事的人就说：这孩子是从哪里生的，他所说的每一句话都应验了？死男孩的父母去见约瑟，责怪他说：既然你有这样一个孩子，你就不可能和我们一起住在村子里；或者教他祝福，而不是诅咒：因为他正在杀害我们的孩子。



5
And Joseph called the child apart, and admonished Him, saying: Why doest thou such things, and these people suffer, and hate us, and persecute us? And Jesus said: I know that these words of thine are not thine own; nevertheless for thy sake I will be silent; but they shall bear their punishment. And straightway those that accused Him were struck blind. And those who saw it were much afraid and in great perplexity, and said about Him: Every word which he spoke, whether good or bad, was an act, and became a wonder. And when they saw that Jesus had done such a thing, Joseph rose and took hold of His ear, and pulled it hard. And the child was very angry, and said to him: It is enough for thee to seek, and not to find; and most certainly thou hast not done wisely. Knowest thou not that I am thine? Do not trouble me.

5
约瑟把孩子叫到一边，劝告他说：你为什么行这样的事，让这些人受苦，恨我们，逼迫我们呢？耶稣说：我知道你这些话不是你自己说的；然而，为了你，我将保持沉默；但他们必受惩罚。那些指责他的人立刻就被蒙蔽了。那些看见的人，都非常害怕，极其困惑，议论他说：他所说的每一句话，无论是好是坏，都是一个行为，都成为奇事。当他们看到耶稣做了这样的事时，约瑟站起来，抓住他的耳朵，用力拉。孩子很生气，对他说：你寻找，而不是找到，就够了；毫无疑问，你做得并不明智。你不知道我是你的吗？别麻烦我了。



6
And a certain teacher, Zacchaeus by name, was standing in a certain place, and heard Jesus thus speaking to his father; and he wondered exceedingly, that, being a child, he should speak in such a way. And a few days thereafter he came to Joseph, and said to him: Thou hast a sensible child, and he has some mind. Give him to me, then, that he may learn letters; and I shall teach him along with the letters all knowledge, both how to address all the elders, and to honour them as forefathers and fathers, and how to love those of his own age. And He said to him all the letters from the Alpha even to the Omega, clearly and with great exactness. And He looked upon the teacher Zacchaeus, and said to him: Thou who art ignorant of the nature of the Alpha, how canst thou teach others the Beta? Thou hypocrite! first, if thou knowest. teach the A, and then we shall believe thee about the B. Then He began to question the teacher about the first letter, and he was not able to answer Him. And in the hearing of many, the child says to Zacchaeus: Hear, O teacher, the order of the first letter, and notice here how it has lines, and a middle stroke crossing those which thou seest common; (lines) brought together; the highest part supporting them, and again bringing them under one head; with three points of intersection; of the same kind; principal and subordinate; of equal length. Thou hast the lines of the A.

6
有一位老师，名叫撒该，站在某个地方，听到耶稣对他的父亲这样说话。他非常奇怪，作为一个孩子，他竟然会用这样的方式说话。几天后，他来到约瑟那里，对他说：你有一个懂事的孩子，他有头脑。那么把他交给我，让他学习字母；我将连同字母一起教给他所有的知识，包括如何称呼所有的长辈，如何尊敬他们如祖先和父亲，以及如何爱与他同龄的人。他清晰而准确地向他说出了从阿尔法到欧米伽的所有字母。他看着老师撒该，对他说：你连A的本质一无所知，怎么能教别人贝塔呢？你这个伪君子！首先，如果你知道的话。教A，然后我们就会相信你关于B。然后他开始向老师询问第一个字母，而他无法回答他。在许多人的耳边，孩子对撒该说：老师啊，请听听第一个字母的顺序，并注意这里它是如何有线条的，以及中间的笔划与你所看到的常见的笔划交叉的； （线）聚集在一起；最高的部分支撑着他们，并再次将他们集中在一个头下；具有三个交点；同类；校长和下属；长度相等。你有A的线条。



7
And when the teacher Zacchaeus heard the child speaking such and so great allegories of the first letter, he was at a great loss about such a narrative, and about His teaching. And He said to those that were present: Alas! I, wretch that I am, am at a loss, bringing shame upon myself by having dragged this child hither. Take him away, then, I beseech thee, brother Joseph. I cannot endure the sternness of his look; I cannot make out his meaning at all. That child does not belong to this earth; he can tame even fire. Assuredly he was born before the creation of the world. What sort of a belly bore him, what sort of a womb nourished him, I do not know. Alas! my friend, he has carried me away; I cannot get at his meaning: thrice wretched that I am, I have deceived myself. I made a struggle to have a scholar, and I was found to have a teacher. My mind is filled with shame, my friends, because I, an old man, have been conquered by a child. There is nothing for me but despondency and death on account of this boy, for I am not able at this hour to look him in the face; and when everybody says that I have been beaten by a little child, what can I say? And how can I give an account of the lines of the first letter that he spoke about? I know not, O my friends; for I can make neither beginning nor end of him. Therefore, I beseech thee, brother Joseph, take him home. What great thing he is, either god or angel, or what I am to say, I know not.

7
当撒该老师听到孩子讲第一个字母如此伟大的寓言时，他对这样的叙述和他的教导感到非常困惑。他对在场的人说：唉！我这个可怜虫，也不知所措，把这孩子拖到这里来，自取其辱。那么，带他走吧，约瑟夫兄弟，我恳求你。我无法忍受他严肃的表情；我根本无法理解他的意思。那个孩子不属于这个地球；他甚至可以驯服火。毫无疑问，他是在创世之前出生的。什么样的肚子孕育着他，什么样的子宫滋养着他，我不知道。唉!我的朋友，他把我带走了；我无法理解他的意思：我是多么可怜，我欺骗了自己。我奋斗得有一个学者，结果发现我有一个老师。我的心里充满了耻辱，我的朋友们，因为我这个老人被一个孩子征服了。对于这个男孩，我除了沮丧和死亡之外别无他法，因为此时我无法直视他的脸。当大家都说我被小孩子打了，我还能说什么？我该如何描述他所说的第一封信的内容呢？我不知道，我的朋友们；因为我既不知道他的开始，也不知道他的结束。因此，约瑟夫弟兄，我恳求你带他回家。他是多么伟大的人物，无论是神还是天使，或者我要说什么，我都不知道。



8
And when the Jews were encouraging Zacchaeus, the child laughed aloud, and said: Now let thy learning bring forth fruit, and let the blind in heart see. I am here from above, that I may curse them, and call them to the things that are above, as He that sent me on your account has commanded me. And when the child ceased speaking, immediately all were made whole who had fallen under His curse. And no one after that dared to make Him angry, lest He should curse him, and he should be maimed.

8
当犹太人鼓励撒该时，孩子大笑起来，说：现在让你的学识结出果实，让心里盲目的人看见吧。我从天上来，是要咒诅他们，呼召他们去做天上的事，正如那为你们差遣我的主所吩咐的。当孩子停止说话时，所有受他咒诅的人立刻就痊愈了。从此以后，没有人敢惹他生气，免得他咒骂他，把他打残。



9
And some days after, Jesus was playing in an upper room of a certain house, and one of the children that were playing with Him fell down from the house, and was killed. And, when the other children saw this, they ran away, and Jesus alone stood still. And the parents of the dead child coming, reproached...and they threatened Him. And Jesus leaped down from the roof, and stood beside the body of the child, and cried with a loud voice, and said: Zeno-for that was his name-stand up, and tell me; did I throw thee down? And he stood up immediately, and said: Certainly not, my lord; thou didst not throw me down, but hast raised me up. And those that saw this were struck with astonishment. And the child's parents glorified God on account of the miracle that had happened, and adored Jesus.

9
几天后，耶稣在一所房子的楼上玩耍时，其中一个和他一起玩耍的孩子从房子里掉下来，摔死了。当其他孩子看到这一幕时，他们都逃跑了，只有耶稣独自站着。死孩子的父母来了，责备……他们威胁他。耶稣从屋顶上跳下来，站在孩子的尸体旁边，大声喊道：“芝诺——因为那是他的名字——站起来，告诉我；我把你扔下去了吗？他立即站起来说：当然不是，大人；你没有把我摔倒，而是把我扶起来。而那些看到这一幕的人，都大吃一惊。孩子的父母因所发生的奇迹而荣耀上帝，并崇拜耶稣。



10
A few days after, a young man was splitting wood in the corner, and the axe came down and cut the sole of his foot in two, and he died from loss of blood. And there was a great commotion, and people ran together, and the child Jesus ran there too. And He pressed through the crowd, and laid hold of the young man's wounded foot, and he was cured immediately. And He said to the young man: Rise up now, split the wood, and remember me. And the crowd seeing what had happened, adored the child, saying: Truly the Spirit of God dwells in this child.

10
几天后，一个年轻人在墙角劈柴，斧子落下，把他的脚底砍成两半，失血过多而死。一阵骚动，人们一起跑，小耶稣也跑到了那里。他挤过人群，抓住年轻人受伤的脚，他立刻就痊愈了。他对年轻人说：现在起来，劈开木头，并记住我。众人看到所发生的事，都崇拜这个孩子，说：神的灵确实住在这个孩子里面。



11
And when He was six years old, His mother gave Him a pitcher, and sent Him to draw water, and bring it into the house. But He struck against some one in the crowd, and the pitcher was broken. And Jesus unfolded the cloak which He had on, and filled it with water, and carried it to His mother. And His mother, seeing the miracle that had happened, kissed Him, and kept within herself the mysteries which she had seen Him doing.

11
当他六岁的时候，他的母亲给了他一个水罐，并打发他去打水，并把水带进屋里。但他击中了人群中的一个人，水罐就被打破了。耶稣展开他所穿的外衣，装满水，带到他母亲那里。他的母亲看到所发生的奇迹，吻了他，并把她所看到的他所行的奥秘记在心里。



12
And again in seed-time the child went out with His father to sow corn in their land. And while His father was sowing, the child Jesus also sowed one gain of corn. And when He had reaped it, and threshed it, He made a hundred kors; and calling all the poor of the village to the threshing-floor, He gave them the corn, and Joseph took away what was left of the corn. And He was eight years old when He did this miracle.

12
到了播种季节，孩子又和他的父亲一起出去在他们的土地上播种谷物。当他的父亲播种时，年幼的耶稣也播种了一份谷物。他收割、打谷的时候，挣了一百个古珥。他把村里所有的穷人都叫到了打谷场，把谷物给了他们，约瑟则拿走了剩下的谷物。当他行这个神迹时，他才八岁。



13
And His father was a carpenter, and at that time made ploughs and yokes. And a certain rich man ordered him to make him a couch. And one of what is called the cross pieces being too short, they did not know what to do. The child Jesus said to His father Joseph: Put down the two pieces of wood, and make them even in the middle. And Joseph did as the child said to him. And Jesus stood at the other end, and took hold of the shorter piece of wood, and stretched it, and made it equal to the other. And His father Joseph saw it, and wondered, and embraced the child, and blessed Him, saying: Blessed am I, because God has given me this child.

13
他的父亲是一名木匠，当时制作犁和轭。某个富翁命令他给他做一张床。其中一个所谓的横梁太短，他们不知道该怎么办。年幼的耶稣对他的父亲约瑟说：把两块木头放在中间，使它们对齐。约瑟就照着孩子的话做了。耶稣站在另一端，握住较短的一块木头，将其拉伸，使其与另一端相等。他的父亲约瑟看到了，很惊奇，拥抱了孩子，祝福他说：“我是有福的，因为上帝给了我这个孩子。”



14
And Joseph, seeing that the child was vigorous in mind and body, again resolved that He should not remain ignorant of the letters, and took Him away, and handed Him over to another teacher. And the teacher said to Joseph: I shall first teach him the Greek letters, and then the Hebrew. For the teacher was aware of the trial that had been made of the child, and was afraid of Him. Nevertheless he wrote out the alphabet, and gave Him all his attention for a long time, and He made him no answer. And Jesus said to him: If thou art really a teacher, and art well acquainted with the letters, tell me the power of the Alpha, and I will tell thee the power of the Beta. And the teacher was enraged at this, and struck Him on the head. And the child, being in pain, cursed him; and immediately he swooned away, and fell to the ground on his face. And the child returned to Joseph's house; and Joseph was grieved, and gave orders to His mother, saying: Do not let him go outside of the door, because those that make him angry die.

14
约瑟见孩子身心健康，再次下定决心，不能让他对这些字母一无所知，于是把他带走，交给了另一位老师。老师对约瑟夫说：我要先教他希腊字母，然后教希伯来字母。因为老师知道孩子所受到的考验，并且害怕他。尽管如此，他还是写出了字母表，并在很长一段时间里全神贯注于他，而他没有回答他。耶稣对他说：如果你真是一位老师，并且熟悉这些字母，请告诉我阿尔法的力量，我就会告诉你贝塔的力量。老师对此很生气，打了他的头。孩子痛苦地咒骂他。他立刻就昏倒了，脸朝下摔在地上。孩子就回到约瑟的家里。约瑟很伤心，就吩咐他的母亲说：不要让他到门外去，因为惹他生气的人都会死。



15
And after some time, another master again, a genuine friend of Joseph, said to him: Bring the child to my school; perhaps I shall be able to flatter him into learning his letters. And Joseph said: If thou hast the courage, brother, take him with thee. And he took Him with him in fear and great agony; but the child went along pleasantly. And going boldly into the school, He found a book lying on the reading-desk; and taking it, He read not the letters that were in it, but opening His mouth, He spoke by the Holy Spirit, and taught the law to those that were standing round. And a great crowd having come together, stood by and heard Him, and wondered at the ripeness of His teaching, and the readiness of His words, and that He, child as He was, spoke in such a way. And Joseph hearing of it, was afraid, and ran to the school, in doubt lest his master too should be without experience. And the master said to Joseph: Know, brother, that I have taken the child as a scholar, and he is full of much grace and wisdom; but I beseech thee, brother, take him home. And when the child heard this, He laughed at him directly, and said: Since thou hast spoken aright, and witnessed aright, for thy sake he also that was struck down shall be cured. And immediately the other master was cured. And Joseph took the child, and went away home.

15
过了一段时间，另一位大师，约瑟夫的真正朋友，再次对他说：把孩子带到我的学校；也许我可以奉承他学习他的字母。约瑟夫说：兄弟，如果你有勇气，就带他一起去吧。他怀着恐惧和极大的痛苦带着他同行。但孩子相处得很愉快。他大胆地走进学校，发现阅览桌上放着一本书；他接过它，没有读里面的字母，而是张开嘴，靠着圣灵说话，向周围站着的人教导律法。一大群人聚集在一起，站在旁边听他讲话，对他教导的成熟性和他话语的准备性感到惊讶，而且他虽然还是个孩子，却能以这样的方式说话。约瑟夫听说了，很害怕，跑到学校，生怕他的老师也没有经验。老師对约瑟说：兄弟，你知道吗，我已经把这孩子当作一个学者了，他充满了恩典和智慧；但我恳求你，兄弟，带他回家。孩子听了，直接嘲笑他，说道：既然你说得对，见证得对，那为你的缘故，那被打倒的人也必得医治。另一位老師立刻就痊愈了。约瑟就带着孩子回家了。



16
And Joseph sent his son James to tie up wood and bring it home, and the child Jesus also followed him. And when James was gathering the fagots, a viper bit James' hand. And when he was racked with pain, and at the point of death, Jesus came near and blew upon the bite; and the pain ceased directly, and the beast burst, and instantly James remained safe and sound.

16
约瑟派他的儿子雅各去捆木头带回家，小耶稣也跟着他。当雅各收集柴草时，一条毒蛇咬了雅各的手。当他痛苦不堪、濒临死亡时，耶稣走近，向被咬的地方吹了​​一口气。疼痛直接停止，那蛇爆裂了，雅各立即安然无恙。



17
And after this the infant of one of Joseph's neighbours fell sick and died, and its mother wept sore. And Jesus heard that there was great lamentation and commotion, and ran in haste, and found the child dead, and touched his breast, and said: I say to thee, child, be not dead, but live, and be with thy mother. And directly it looked up and laughed. And He said to the woman: Take it, and give it milk, and remember me. And seeing this, the crowd that was standing by wondered, and said: Truly this child was either God or an angel of God, for every word of his is a certain fact. And Jesus went out thence, playing with the other children.

17
此后，约瑟的一位邻居的婴儿病死了，他的母亲痛哭不已。耶稣听见有极大的哀哭和骚乱，就急忙跑去，发现孩子死了，就摸着他的胸口说：“我告诉你，孩子，不要死，只要活着，就能和你母亲在一起。”它直接抬起头笑了起来。他对女人说：拿着它，给它牛奶，然后记念我。旁边的众人见状，纷纷惊叹道：这孩子真是神，或者是神的使者，他说的每一句话都是事实。耶稣就从那里出去，和其他孩子一起玩耍。



18
And some time after there occurred a great commotion while a house was building, and Jesus stood up and went away to the place. And seeing a man lying dead, He took him by the hand, and said: Man, I say to thee, arise, and go on with thy work. And directly he rose up, and adored Him. And seeing this, the crowd wondered, and said: This child is from heaven, for he has saved many souls from death, and he continues to save during all his life.

18
过了一段时间，盖房子的时候发生了一场大骚动，耶稣站起来，往那个地方走去。耶稣看见一个人躺在地上死了，就拉着他的手说：“伙计，我吩咐你起来，继续你的工作。”他立刻站起来，敬拜他。众人见状，惊叹不已，说道：这个孩子是从天上来的，他拯救了许多灵魂免于死亡，而且他一生都在继续拯救。



19.1
And when He was twelve years old His parents went as usual to Jerusalem to the feast of the passover with their fellow-travellers. And after the passover they were coming home again. And while they were coming home, the child Jesus went back to Jerusalem. And His parents thought that He was in the company.

19.1
当他十二岁的时候，他的父母像往常一样和他们的旅伴一起去耶路撒冷过逾越节。逾越节过后，他们又要回家了。当他们回家的时候，年幼的耶稣回到了耶路撒冷。他的父母认为他在親戚家里。



19.2
And having gone one day's journey, they sought for Him among their relations; and not finding Him, they were in great grief, and turned back to the city seeking for Him.
And after the third day they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing the law and asking them questions. And they were all attending to Him, and wondering that He, being a child, was shutting the mouths of the elders and teachers of the people, explaining the main points of the law and the parables of the prophets.

19.2
他们走了一日的路程，就在亲族中寻找他。他们既没有找到他，就非常悲痛，就回城里寻找他。
第三天之后，他们在圣殿里找到了他，他坐在教师中间，一边听律法，一边问他们问题。他们都在注视着他，并奇怪他作为一个孩子，却堵住了长老和教师的嘴，解释了律法的要点和先知的比喻。



19.3
And His mother Mary coming up, said to Him: Why hast thou done this to us, child? Behold, we have been seeking for thee in great trouble. And Jesus said to them: Why do you seek me? Do you not know that I must be about my Father's business?

19.3
他的母亲玛利亚走过来对他说：孩子，你为什么这样对我们？看哪，我们一直在极大的困难中寻找你。耶稣对他们说：你们为什么找我？难道你不知道我必须关心我父亲的事吗？



19.4
And the scribes and the Pharisees said: Art thou the mother of this child? And she said: I am. And they said to her: Blessed art thou among women, for God hath blessed the fruit of thy womb; for such glory, and such virtue and wisdom, we have neither seen nor heard ever.

19.4
文士和法利赛人说：你是这孩子的母亲吗？她说：我是。他们对她说：你在妇女中是有福的，因为上帝赐福给你腹中的胎儿。这样的荣耀，这样的美德和智慧，我们从未见过，也从未听说过。



19.5
And Jesus rose up, and followed His mother, and was subject to His parents. And His mother observed all these things that had happened. And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and stature, and grace. To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

19.5
耶稣就起来，跟随他的母亲，顺服他的父母。他的母亲观察了所发生的这一切事情。耶稣的智慧、身量和恩典都长进了。愿荣耀归给他，直到永永远远。阿门。
