Infancy Gospel of Thomas
多马婴儿福音

1
I, Thomas the Israelite, tell unto you, even all the brethren that are of the Gentiles, to make known unto you the works of the childhood of our Lord Jesus Christ and his mighty deeds, even all that he did when he was born in our land: whereof the beginning is thus:

1
我，以色列人多马，告诉你们，就是所有的外邦弟兄，要叫你们知道我们的主耶稣基督幼年时的作为，和他的大能事迹，就是他出生在我们的土地上时所做的一切。其起初是这样的:



2
This child Jesus, when five years old, was playing in the ford of a mountain stream; and He collected the flowing waters into pools, and made them clear immediately, and by a word alone He made them obey Him. And having made some soft clay, He fashioned out of it twelve sparrows. And it was the Sabbath when He did these things. And there were also many other children playing with Him. And a certain Jew, seeing what Jesus was doing, playing on the Sabbath, went off immediately, and said to his father Joseph: Behold, thy son is at the stream, and has taken clay, and made of it twelve birds, and has profaned the Sabbath. And Joseph, coming to the place and seeing, cried out to Him, saying: Wherefore doest thou on the Sabbath what it is not lawful to do? And Jesus clapped His hands, and cried out to the sparrows, and said to them: Off you go! And the sparrows flew, and went off crying. And the Jews seeing this were amazed, and went away and reported to their chief men what they had seen Jesus doing.

2
耶稣五岁时，正在山涧的浅滩玩耍。他把流水聚成池子，立刻就使它们清澈，只用一句话就使他们服从了他。他和了一些软土，用它捏出了十二只麻雀。他做这些事的时候正是安息日。还有许多其他的孩子和他一起玩耍。有一个犹太人，看见耶稣在安息日所做的事，就立刻去对他父亲约瑟说：看哪，你儿子在溪边，拿泥捏了十二只鸟，做了十二只鸟。亵渎了安息日。约瑟到了那地方，看见了，就喊着说：“为什么你在安息日作不许做的事呢？”耶稣拍手，向麻雀喊叫说：你们走吧！麻雀飞了，啼叫着走了。犹太人看见这事就希奇，就去将所看见耶稣所做的事报告给他们的首领。



3
And the son of Annas the scribe was standing there with Joseph; and he took a willow branch, and let out the waters which Jesus bad collected. And Jesus, seeing what was done, was angry, and said to him: O wicked, impious, and foolish! what harm did the pools and the waters do to thee? Behold, even now thou shalt be dried up like a tree, and thou shalt not bring forth either leaves, or root, or fruit. And straightway that boy was quite dried up. And Jesus departed, and went to Joseph's house. But the parents of the boy that had been dried up took him up, bewailing his youth, and brought him to Joseph, and reproached him because, said they, thou hast such a child doing such things.

3
文士亚那的儿子和约瑟一同站在那里。他拿起一根柳枝，把耶稣收集的水放了出来。耶稣看见所发生的事，就生气，对他说：“你这邪恶的、不敬虔的、愚昧的人哪！水池和水对你造成了什么伤害？看哪，现在你必像一棵树一样枯干，不能长出叶子，不能长出根，也不能长出果子。那男孩立刻就干瘪了。耶稣就起身往约瑟的家里去。但是那个已经干涸的男孩的父母却把他抱起来，哀叹他的年轻，把他带到约瑟那里，并责备他，因为他们说，你有这样一个孩子做这样的事。



4
After that He was again passing through the village; and a boy ran up against Him, and struck His shoulder. And Jesus was angry, and said to him: Thou shalt not go back the way thou camest. And immediately he fell down dead. And some who saw what had taken place, said: Whence was this child begotten, that every word of his is certainly accomplished? And the parents of the dead boy went away to Joseph, and blamed him, saying: Since thou hast such a child, it is impossible for thee to live with us in the village; or else teach him to bless, and not to curse: for he is killing our children.

4
此后，他再次经过这个村庄。一个男孩向他跑去，打他的肩膀。耶稣很生气，对他说：你不可按原路回去。他立刻就倒地死了。有的看见这事的人就说：这孩子是从哪里生的，他所说的每一句话都应验了？死男孩的父母去见约瑟，责怪他说：既然你有这样一个孩子，你就不可能和我们一起住在村子里；或者教他祝福，而不是诅咒：因为他正在杀害我们的孩子。



5
And Joseph called the child apart, and admonished Him, saying: Why doest thou such things, and these people suffer, and hate us, and persecute us? And Jesus said: I know that these words of thine are not thine own; nevertheless for thy sake I will be silent; but they shall bear their punishment. And straightway those that accused Him were struck blind. And those who saw it were much afraid and in great perplexity, and said about Him: Every word which he spoke, whether good or bad, was an act, and became a wonder. And when they saw that Jesus had done such a thing, Joseph rose and took hold of His ear, and pulled it hard. And the child was very angry, and said to him: It is enough for thee to seek, and not to find; and most certainly thou hast not done wisely. Knowest thou not that I am thine? Do not trouble me.

5
约瑟把孩子叫到一边，劝告他说：你为什么行这样的事，让这些人受苦，恨我们，逼迫我们呢？耶稣说：我知道你这些话不是你自己说的；然而，为了你，我将保持沉默；但他们必受惩罚。那些指责他的人立刻就被蒙蔽了。那些看见的人，都非常害怕，极其困惑，议论他说：他所说的每一句话，无论是好是坏，都是一个行为，都成为奇事。当他们看到耶稣做了这样的事时，约瑟站起来，抓住他的耳朵，用力拉。孩子很生气，对他说：你寻找，而不是找到，就够了；毫无疑问，你做得并不明智。你不知道我是你的吗？别麻烦我了。



6
And a certain teacher, Zacchaeus by name, was standing in a certain place, and heard Jesus thus speaking to his father; and he wondered exceedingly, that, being a child, he should speak in such a way. And a few days thereafter he came to Joseph, and said to him: Thou hast a sensible child, and he has some mind. Give him to me, then, that he may learn letters; and I shall teach him along with the letters all knowledge, both how to address all the elders, and to honour them as forefathers and fathers, and how to love those of his own age. And He said to him all the letters from the Alpha even to the Omega, clearly and with great exactness. And He looked upon the teacher Zacchaeus, and said to him: Thou who art ignorant of the nature of the Alpha, how canst thou teach others the Beta? Thou hypocrite! first, if thou knowest. teach the A, and then we shall believe thee about the B. Then He began to question the teacher about the first letter, and he was not able to answer Him. And in the hearing of many, the child says to Zacchaeus: Hear, O teacher, the order of the first letter, and notice here how it has lines, and a middle stroke crossing those which thou seest common; (lines) brought together; the highest part supporting them, and again bringing them under one head; with three points of intersection; of the same kind; principal and subordinate; of equal length. Thou hast the lines of the A.

6
有一位老师，名叫撒该，站在某个地方，听到耶稣对他的父亲这样说话。他非常奇怪，作为一个孩子，他竟然会用这样的方式说话。几天后，他来到约瑟那里，对他说：你有一个懂事的孩子，他有头脑。那么把他交给我，让他学习字母；我将连同字母一起教给他所有的知识，包括如何称呼所有的长辈，如何尊敬他们如祖先和父亲，以及如何爱与他同龄的人。他清晰而准确地向他说出了从阿尔法到欧米伽的所有字母。他看着老师撒该，对他说: 你连A的本质一无所知，怎么能教别人贝塔呢？你这个伪君子！首先，如果你知道的话。教A，然后我们就会相信你关于B。然后他开始向老师询问第一个字母，而他无法回答他。在许多人的耳边，孩子对撒该说：老师啊，请听听第一个字母的顺序，并注意这里它是如何有线条(形式)的，以及中间的笔划与你所看到的常见的笔划交叉的；(线)聚集在一起；最高的部分支撑着他们，并再次将他们集中在一个头下；具有三个交点；同理；首長和下属；长度相等。你就有A的线条(形式)了。



7
And when the teacher Zacchaeus heard the child speaking such and so great allegories of the first letter, he was at a great loss about such a narrative, and about His teaching. And He said to those that were present: Alas! I, wretch that I am, am at a loss, bringing shame upon myself by having dragged this child hither. Take him away, then, I beseech thee, brother Joseph. I cannot endure the sternness of his look; I cannot make out his meaning at all. That child does not belong to this earth; he can tame even fire. Assuredly he was born before the creation of the world. What sort of a belly bore him, what sort of a womb nourished him, I do not know. Alas! my friend, he has carried me away; I cannot get at his meaning: thrice wretched that I am, I have deceived myself. I made a struggle to have a scholar, and I was found to have a teacher. My mind is filled with shame, my friends, because I, an old man, have been conquered by a child. There is nothing for me but despondency and death on account of this boy, for I am not able at this hour to look him in the face; and when everybody says that I have been beaten by a little child, what can I say? And how can I give an account of the lines of the first letter that he spoke about? I know not, O my friends; for I can make neither beginning nor end of him. Therefore, I beseech thee, brother Joseph, take him home. What great thing he is, either god or angel, or what I am to say, I know not.

7
当撒该老师听到孩子讲第一个字母如此伟大的寓言时，他对这样的叙述和他的教导感到非常困惑。他对在场的人说：唉！我这个可怜虫，也不知所措，把这孩子拖到这里来，自取其辱。那么，带他走吧，约瑟夫兄弟，我恳求你。我无法忍受他严肃的表情；我根本无法理解他的意思。那个孩子不属于这个大地；他甚至可以驯服火。毫无疑问，他是在创世之前出生的。什么样的肚子孕育着他，什么样的子宫滋养着他，我不知道。唉! 我的朋友，他把我带走了；我无法理解他的意思：我是多么可怜，我欺骗了自己。我奋斗得有一个学者，结果发现我有一个老师。我的心里充满了耻辱，我的朋友们，因为我这个老人被一个孩子征服了。对于这个男孩，我除了沮丧和死亡之外别无他法，因为此时我无法直视他的脸。当大家都说我被小孩子打敗了，我还能说什么？我该如何描述他所说的第一个字母的内容呢？我不知道，我的朋友们；因为我既不知道他的开始，也不知道他的结束。因此，约瑟夫弟兄，我恳求你带他回家。他是多么伟大的人物，无论是神还是天使，或者我要说什么，我都不知道。



8
And when the Jews were encouraging Zacchaeus, the child laughed aloud, and said: Now let thy learning bring forth fruit, and let the blind in heart see. I am here from above, that I may curse them, and call them to the things that are above, as He that sent me on your account has commanded me. And when the child ceased speaking, immediately all were made whole who had fallen under His curse. And no one after that dared to make Him angry, lest He should curse him, and he should be maimed.

8
当犹太人鼓励撒该时，孩子大笑起来，说: 现在让你的学识结出果实，让心里盲目的人看见吧。我从天上来，是要咒诅他们，呼召他们去做天上的事，正如那为你们差遣我的主所吩咐的。当孩子停止说话时，所有受他咒诅的人立刻就痊愈了。从此以后，没有人敢惹他生气，免得他咒骂他，叫他變成傷残。



9
And some days after, Jesus was playing in an upper room of a certain house, and one of the children that were playing with Him fell down from the house, and was killed. And, when the other children saw this, they ran away, and Jesus alone stood still. And the parents of the dead child coming, reproached...and they threatened Him. And Jesus leaped down from the roof, and stood beside the body of the child, and cried with a loud voice, and said: Zeno-for that was his name-stand up, and tell me; did I throw thee down? And he stood up immediately, and said: Certainly not, my lord; thou didst not throw me down, but hast raised me up. And those that saw this were struck with astonishment. And the child's parents glorified God on account of the miracle that had happened, and adored Jesus.

9
几天后，耶稣在一所房子的楼上玩耍时，其中一个和他一起玩耍的孩子从房子里掉下来，摔死了。当其他孩子看到这一幕时，他们都逃跑了，只有耶稣独自站着。死孩子的父母来了，责备...他们威胁他。耶稣从屋顶上跳下来，站在孩子的尸体旁边，大声喊道: “芝诺——因为那是他的名字——站起来，告诉我；我把你扔下去了吗？他立即站起来说: 当然不是，大人；你没有把我摔倒，而是把我扶起来。而那些看到这一幕的人，都大吃一惊。孩子的父母因所发生的奇迹而荣耀上帝，并崇拜耶稣。



10
A few days after, a young man was splitting wood in the corner, and the axe came down and cut the sole of his foot in two, and he died from loss of blood. And there was a great commotion, and people ran together, and the child Jesus ran there too. And He pressed through the crowd, and laid hold of the young man's wounded foot, and he was cured immediately. And He said to the young man: Rise up now, split the wood, and remember me. And the crowd seeing what had happened, adored the child, saying: Truly the Spirit of God dwells in this child.

10
几天后，一个年轻人在墙角劈柴，斧子落下，把他的脚底砍成两半，失血过多而死。一阵骚动，人们一起跑，小耶稣也跑到了那里。他挤过人群，抓住年轻人受伤的脚，他立刻就痊愈了。他对年轻人说：现在起来，劈开木头，并记住我。众人看到所发生的事，都崇拜这个孩子，说：神的灵确实住在这个孩子里面。



11
And when He was six years old, His mother gave Him a pitcher, and sent Him to draw water, and bring it into the house. But He struck against some one in the crowd, and the pitcher was broken. And Jesus unfolded the cloak which He had on, and filled it with water, and carried it to His mother. And His mother, seeing the miracle that had happened, kissed Him, and kept within herself the mysteries which she had seen Him doing.

11
当他六岁的时候，他的母亲给了他一个水罐，并打发他去打水，并把水带进屋里。但他击中了人群中的一个人，水罐就被打破了。耶稣展开他所穿的外衣，装满水，带到他母亲那里。他的母亲看到所发生的奇迹，吻了他，并把她所看到的他所行的奥秘记在心里。



12
And again in seed-time the child went out with His father to sow corn in their land. And while His father was sowing, the child Jesus also sowed one gain of corn. And when He had reaped it, and threshed it, He made a hundred kors; and calling all the poor of the village to the threshing-floor, He gave them the corn, and Joseph took away what was left of the corn. And He was eight years old when He did this miracle.

12
到了播种季节，孩子又和他的父亲一起出去在他们的土地上播种谷物。当他的父亲播种时，年幼的耶稣也播种了一份谷物。他收割、打谷的时候，挣了一百个古珥。他把村里所有的穷人都叫到了打谷场，把谷物给了他们，约瑟则拿走了剩下的谷物。当他行这个神迹时，他才八岁。



13
And His father was a carpenter, and at that time made ploughs and yokes. And a certain rich man ordered him to make him a couch. And one of what is called the cross pieces being too short, they did not know what to do. The child Jesus said to His father Joseph: Put down the two pieces of wood, and make them even in the middle. And Joseph did as the child said to him. And Jesus stood at the other end, and took hold of the shorter piece of wood, and stretched it, and made it equal to the other. And His father Joseph saw it, and wondered, and embraced the child, and blessed Him, saying: Blessed am I, because God has given me this child.

13
他的父亲是一名木匠，当时制作犁和轭。某个富翁命令他给他做一张床。其中一个所谓的横梁太短，他们不知道该怎么办。年幼的耶稣对他的父亲约瑟说：把两块木头放在中间，使它们对齐。约瑟就照着孩子的话做了。耶稣站在另一端，握住较短的一块木头，将其拉伸，使其与另一端相等。他的父亲约瑟看到了，很惊奇，拥抱了孩子，祝福他说：“我是有福的，因为上帝给了我这个孩子。”



14
And Joseph, seeing that the child was vigorous in mind and body, again resolved that He should not remain ignorant of the letters, and took Him away, and handed Him over to another teacher. And the teacher said to Joseph: I shall first teach him the Greek letters, and then the Hebrew. For the teacher was aware of the trial that had been made of the child, and was afraid of Him. Nevertheless he wrote out the alphabet, and gave Him all his attention for a long time, and He made him no answer. And Jesus said to him: If thou art really a teacher, and art well acquainted with the letters, tell me the power of the Alpha, and I will tell thee the power of the Beta. And the teacher was enraged at this, and struck Him on the head. And the child, being in pain, cursed him; and immediately he swooned away, and fell to the ground on his face. And the child returned to Joseph's house; and Joseph was grieved, and gave orders to His mother, saying: Do not let him go outside of the door, because those that make him angry die.

14
约瑟见孩子身心健康，再次下定决心，不能让他对这些字母一无所知，于是把他带走，交给了另一位老师。老师对约瑟夫说：我要先教他希腊字母，然后教希伯来字母。因为老师知道孩子所受到的考验，并且害怕他。尽管如此，他还是写出了字母表，并在很长一段时间里全神贯注于他，而他没有回答他。耶稣对他说：如果你真是一位老师，并且熟悉这些字母，请告诉我阿尔法的力量，我就会告诉你贝塔的力量。老师对此很生气，打了他的头。孩子痛苦地咒骂他。他立刻就昏倒了，脸朝下摔在地上。孩子就回到约瑟的家里。约瑟很伤心，就吩咐他的母亲说：不要让他到门外去，因为惹他生气的人都会死。



15
And after some time, another master again, a genuine friend of Joseph, said to him: Bring the child to my school; perhaps I shall be able to flatter him into learning his letters. And Joseph said: If thou hast the courage, brother, take him with thee. And he took Him with him in fear and great agony; but the child went along pleasantly. And going boldly into the school, He found a book lying on the reading-desk; and taking it, He read not the letters that were in it, but opening His mouth, He spoke by the Holy Spirit, and taught the law to those that were standing round. And a great crowd having come together, stood by and heard Him, and wondered at the ripeness of His teaching, and the readiness of His words, and that He, child as He was, spoke in such a way. And Joseph hearing of it, was afraid, and ran to the school, in doubt lest his master too should be without experience. And the master said to Joseph: Know, brother, that I have taken the child as a scholar, and he is full of much grace and wisdom; but I beseech thee, brother, take him home. And when the child heard this, He laughed at him directly, and said: Since thou hast spoken aright, and witnessed aright, for thy sake he also that was struck down shall be cured. And immediately the other master was cured. And Joseph took the child, and went away home.

15
过了一段时间，另一位老师，约瑟夫的真正朋友，再次对他说：把孩子带到我的学校；也许我可以奉承他学习他的字母。约瑟夫说：兄弟，如果你有勇气，就带他一起去吧。他怀着恐惧和极大的痛苦带着他同行。但孩子相处得很愉快。他大胆地走进学校，发现阅览桌上放着一本书；他接过它，没有读里面的字母，而是张开嘴，靠着圣灵说话，向周围站着的人教导律法。一大群人聚集在一起，站在旁边听他讲话，对他教导的成熟性和他话语的准备性感到惊讶，而且他虽然还是个孩子，却能以这样的方式说话。约瑟夫听说了，很害怕，跑到学校，生怕他的老师也没有经验。老師对约瑟说：兄弟，你知道吗，我已经把这孩子当作一个学者了，他充满了恩典和智慧；但我恳求你，兄弟，带他回家。孩子听了，直接笑著對他说道：既然你说得对，见证得对，那为你的缘故，那被打倒的人也必得医治。另一位老師立刻就痊愈了。约瑟就带着孩子回家了。



16
And Joseph sent his son James to tie up wood and bring it home, and the child Jesus also followed him. And when James was gathering the fagots, a viper bit James' hand. And when he was racked with pain, and at the point of death, Jesus came near and blew upon the bite; and the pain ceased directly, and the beast burst, and instantly James remained safe and sound.

16
约瑟派他的儿子雅各去捆木头带回家，小耶稣也跟着他。当雅各收集柴草时，一条毒蛇咬了雅各的手。当他痛苦不堪、濒临死亡时，耶稣走近，向被咬的地方吹了​​一口气。疼痛直接停止，那蛇爆裂了，雅各立即安然无恙。



17
And after this the infant of one of Joseph's neighbours fell sick and died, and its mother wept sore. And Jesus heard that there was great lamentation and commotion, and ran in haste, and found the child dead, and touched his breast, and said: I say to thee, child, be not dead, but live, and be with thy mother. And directly it looked up and laughed. And He said to the woman: Take it, and give it milk, and remember me. And seeing this, the crowd that was standing by wondered, and said: Truly this child was either God or an angel of God, for every word of his is a certain fact. And Jesus went out thence, playing with the other children.

17
此后，约瑟的一位邻居的婴儿病死了，他的母亲痛哭不已。耶稣听见有极大的哀哭和骚乱，就急忙跑去，发现孩子死了，就摸着他的胸口说：“我告诉你，孩子，不要死，只要活着，就能和你母亲在一起。”它直接抬起头笑了起来。他对女人说：拿着它，给它牛奶，然后记念我。旁边的众人见状，纷纷惊叹道：这孩子真是神，或者是神的使者，他说的每一句话都是事实。耶稣就从那里出去，和其他孩子一起玩耍。



18
And some time after there occurred a great commotion while a house was building, and Jesus stood up and went away to the place. And seeing a man lying dead, He took him by the hand, and said: Man, I say to thee, arise, and go on with thy work. And directly he rose up, and adored Him. And seeing this, the crowd wondered, and said: This child is from heaven, for he has saved many souls from death, and he continues to save during all his life.

18
过了一段时间，盖房子的时候发生了一场大骚动，耶稣站起来，往那个地方走去。耶稣看见一个人躺在地上死了，就拉着他的手说：“伙计，我吩咐你起来，继续你的工作。”他立刻站起来，敬拜他。众人见状，惊叹不已，说道：这个孩子是从天上来的，他拯救了许多灵魂免于死亡，而且他一生都在继续拯救。



19.1
And when He was twelve years old His parents went as usual to Jerusalem to the feast of the passover with their fellow-travellers. And after the passover they were coming home again. And while they were coming home, the child Jesus went back to Jerusalem. And His parents thought that He was in the company.

19.1
当他十二岁的时候，他的父母像往常一样和他们的旅伴一起去耶路撒冷过逾越节。逾越节过后，他们又要回家了。当他们回家的时候，年幼的耶稣回到了耶路撒冷。他的父母以为他在同行的人中間。



19.2
And having gone one day's journey, they sought for Him among their relations; and not finding Him, they were in great grief, and turned back to the city seeking for Him.
And after the third day they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing the law and asking them questions. And they were all attending to Him, and wondering that He, being a child, was shutting the mouths of the elders and teachers of the people, explaining the main points of the law and the parables of the prophets.

19.2
他们走了一日的路程，就在亲族中寻找他。他们既没有找到他，就非常悲痛，就回城里寻找他。
第三天之后，他们在圣殿里找到了他，他坐在教师中间，一边听律法，一边问他们问题。他们都在注视着他，并奇怪他作为一个孩子，却堵住了长老和教师的嘴，解释了律法的要点和先知的比喻。



19.3
And His mother Mary coming up, said to Him: Why hast thou done this to us, child? Behold, we have been seeking for thee in great trouble. And Jesus said to them: Why do you seek me? Do you not know that I must be about my Father's business?

19.3
他的母亲玛利亚走过来对他说：孩子，你为什么这样对我们？看哪，我们一直在极大的困难中寻找你。耶稣对他们说：你们为什么找我？难道你不知道我必须关心我父亲的事吗？



19.4
And the scribes and the Pharisees said: Art thou the mother of this child? And she said: I am. And they said to her: Blessed art thou among women, for God hath blessed the fruit of thy womb; for such glory, and such virtue and wisdom, we have neither seen nor heard ever.

19.4
文士和法利赛人说：你是这孩子的母亲吗？她说：我是。他们对她说：你在妇女中是有福的，因为上帝赐福给你腹中的胎儿。这样的荣耀，这样的美德和智慧，我们从未见过，也从未听说过。



19.5
And Jesus rose up, and followed His mother, and was subject to His parents. And His mother observed all these things that had happened. And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and stature, and grace. To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

19.5
耶稣就起来，跟随他的母亲，顺服他的父母。他的母亲观察了所发生的这一切事情。耶稣的智慧、身量和恩典都长进了。愿荣耀归给他，直到永永远远。阿门。
