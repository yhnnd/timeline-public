In Dayan.

Today is very hot outside. I went out for a walk. I went to the Sixth Elementary School.

The school was abandoned long time ago and the campus of it was dumped with garbage.

I went back to the First Elementary School and the guard of that school won't let me in. I had a quarrel with that guard.
